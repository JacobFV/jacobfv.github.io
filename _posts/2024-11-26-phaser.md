## The Promise and Limitations of Optical Computing

Near the end of my senior year I was searching for ways to change the world so I revisited a lot of our current technological limitations from first principles to identify opportunities for order-of-magnitude improvements. Some YouTube video (i forgot which) led me to [Bernstein et al. at MIT](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2205.09103) and reading it impressed me with the significant but largely unexplored potential of photonic computation.[^1]

[^1]: alongside the other two frontiers I'd already been exploring: [humanoid robotics](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2023/the-master-plan-part-0/) and [computer agents](https://jacobfv.github.io/projects/full_stack_artificial_intelligence/).

The appeals of optical computing are compelling: Photons travel at the speed of light. They don't generate heat through resistance. They can pass through each other without interference which unlocks massive parallelism. They offer inherently analog computation through wave interference. Free space optical neural networks (fsONNs) in particular have demonstrated these advantages in free-space optics (air) which hints at the potential for massive scalability

However, OP's fsONN and ones since suffer from critical limitations:

- **Scale constraints**: Early implementations handled only small input vectors (~10s of elements). Obv, we can scale, but this may require re-thinking some design choices from a cost/logistics perspective to make system with order-of-magnitude performance/&dollar; impact.
- **Inflexibility**: Fixed weighting masks and bulky modulators prevented dynamic reconfiguration. Some approaches since OP have used photosensitive substrates with auxiliary modulating beams, but these still require complex calibration and need to be integrated into a full-stack system arthictecure to be useful.
- **Architecture limitations**: Most critically, they were restricted to feedforward architectures without the temporal dynamics that make neural networks truly powerful. So rather than compounding $$O(N^2)$$ possible operations they can only perform $$O(N)$$ operations.

## The Recurrent Photon Chamber Concept

Now imagine breaking free from these constraints. What if instead of passing light through a system once, we recirculate it in a carefully controlled loop? Picture a recurrent optical neural network where photons circulate through programmable filters billions of times per second, accumulating computational transformations with each pass. This is the core insight behind PHASER: my plan to using a recurrent photon chamber to achieve the temporal dynamics missing from current fsONNs.

## How It Works

The main idea is: arrange mirrors to create a closed optical cavity where photons can circulate indefinitely. Place programmable spatial light modulators (like LCD filters) in the beam path. As light passes through these filters repeatedly, each traversal implements a matrix multiplication through controlled diffraction and interference. By carefully designing the filter patterns, we can perform complex computations that evolve over thousands of iterations.

Think of it as a vanilla RNN $$h_t = M_{in} x_t + M_{step} h_{t-1}$$, $$y_t = M_{out} h_t$$. A laser beam $$x = \mathbb{1}^n$$ enters through a one-way mirror, it circulates through the programmable filters $$M_{in}$$, $$M_{step}$$ accumulating computational results $$h$$, and eventually exits to a detector array where we read out the final state $$y$$. The key innovation is that unlike traditional optical systems that process information in a single pass, PHASER leverages temporal recursion and the speed of light to achieve high computational depth without physical depth.

Consider the computational density this enables: For a photon looping through 10 stacked 1000×1000 pixel LCDs in a compact optical cavity, we can calculate the actual computational throughput from first principles.

Given:
- Cavity perimeter: $$L \approx 1$$ meter (reasonable for tabletop optics)
- Speed of light: $$c = 3 \times 10^8$$ m/s  
- Number of LCD layers: $$N = 10$$
- Pixels per LCD: $$P = 1000 \times 1000 = 10^6$$

So that's a round-trip frequency of:
$$f_{round} = \frac{c}{L} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{1 \text{ m}} = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ Hz}$$

And each round-trip involves $$N \times P = 10^7$$ pixel interactions, giving us a computational throughput of:
$$\text{Operations/sec} = f_{round} \times N \times P = 3 \times 10^8 \times 10^7 = 3 \times 10^{15} \text{ ops/s}$$

This represents 3 petaoperations per second from a single beam in a meter-scale cavity. Each pixel interaction involves diffraction and interference effects that, when carefully orchestrated, perform meaningful computation. Over thousands of iterations (occurring in milliseconds), these simple per-pixel operations compound into complex transformations.

The classical nature of the system (using many photons rather than single-photon quantum effects) ensures robustness while still leveraging the fundamental advantages of optical computation: parallelism, speed, and energy efficiency.

### Documentation of the PHASER System Design

#### Overview
The PHASER system is a computational architecture leveraging the diffraction and filtering of light through high-frequency controllable filters. The design operates by iteratively manipulating a photon beam in a closed loop, where computations are encoded in the filtering patterns of the optical system. 

The system is built with the following components and principles:

---

### **System Components**
1. **Light Source:**
   - **Lasers**: Serve as the photon source, providing a coherent and high-intensity light beam.
   - **Side-Mounted Lasers**: Additional laser inputs positioned around the device for added versatility or multi-channel operations.

2. **Image Sensor:**
   - A **CCD** or equivalent image sensor is placed at the output to capture the computational result encoded in the light's diffraction pattern.

3. **Optical Path:**
   - **Convex Lens**: Focuses the light beam for precise traversal through optical layers.
   - **Silver Mirror**: Redirects the light in the closed-loop system for repeated passes through the filtering layers.

4. **Filtering Layers:**
   - **LCD-Based or Electro-Optical Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs):** Act as the programmable filters. Each layer diffracts or passes photons based on a pixel-specific transmission pattern.
   - **KDP (Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate):** A material used in some layers for electro-optic modulation, achieving higher frequencies than LCDs.
   - **NEMS (Nano-Electromechanical Systems) Mirror Array:** Enhances the control over light redirection or filtering precision.

5. **Enclosure:**
   - A **Square Internally Reflective Case** ensures minimal light loss and consistent photon recycling within the computational loop.

---

### **Operational Design**
- **Input and Loop:**
   1. Laser light enters from the top of the device.
   2. The beam passes through a series of stacked filtering layers.
   3. Filters are programmed to selectively pass or diffract photons based on the desired computation.

- **Filtering and Feedback:**
   - After passing through the filters, the light is reflected back into the stack by the silver mirror.
   - The process is repeated for thousands of iterations to accumulate computational effects encoded in the photon diffraction patterns.

- **Computation and Output:**
   - After the loop, the photon beam is diverted to the CCD sensor.
   - The complex norms of the light are measured, capturing the computational result.

---

### **Design Features**
1. **Layer Stack:**
   - Layers are grouped into **Booster Layers** (to amplify computational effects) and **Filter Layers** (to encode specific operations).
   - Layers are based on materials capable of high-speed modulation (e.g., **ITO-Sandwiched KDP** for MHz+ performance).

2. **Token Identification:**
   - The system uses pulse-train patterns (one-hot pulse train) and Fourier modes for "counting" bits, enabling frequency-domain computation.

3. **Modulation Speed:**
   - LCDs provide fine-grain control but operate at slower speeds (~1kHz).
   - Future iterations may implement high-frequency solutions like electro-optic KDP or MEMS-based alternatives to achieve >10 MHz control rates.

---

### **Challenges**
1. **Modulation Speed:**
   - Current LCD technology is too slow (1kHz) for the desired 10+ MHz operation. Alternatives such as ITO-sandwiched KDP or other electro-optic materials are under consideration.
2. **Photon Recycling:**
   - Ensuring minimal loss of photon energy during repeated iterations in the loop.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Development of custom high-frequency filters using advanced materials like **ITO-KDP**.
2. Exploration of faster switching elements, including MEMS mirrors and electro-optic polymers.
3. Scaling to larger filter arrays (e.g., 1000x1000 pixels per layer) for increased computational density.

This design provides a foundational layout for a high-performance light-based computing system, combining advanced optics with cutting-edge materials for unprecedented processing speeds.
