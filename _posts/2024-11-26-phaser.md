> I am making a computer that 'computes' by filtering and diffracting a lasar beam in a mirror loop. So light enters the top, passes through some LCDs which act as filters, reflects back around, passes through filters again, and so on for 1000s iterations. Each time the photon passes through a transparent pixel in the LCD filter, it gets diffracted, and if the masks are designed in a meaningful way, then the whole system can perform useful computation. Then it gets diverted to a ccd and we measure the complex norms (but since its a large number of photons i doubt there will be quantum effects). Anyway its a method i want to use to perform large computations in a very fast time since a photon looping through 10 stacked 1000x1000 LCDs at 10Ghz would represent a LOT of computation power.

### Documentation of the PHASER System Design

#### Overview
The PHASER system is a computational architecture leveraging the diffraction and filtering of light through high-frequency controllable filters. The design operates by iteratively manipulating a photon beam in a closed loop, where computations are encoded in the filtering patterns of the optical system. 

The system is built with the following components and principles:

---

### **System Components**
1. **Light Source:**
   - **Lasers**: Serve as the photon source, providing a coherent and high-intensity light beam.
   - **Side-Mounted Lasers**: Additional laser inputs positioned around the device for added versatility or multi-channel operations.

2. **Image Sensor:**
   - A **CCD** or equivalent image sensor is placed at the output to capture the computational result encoded in the light's diffraction pattern.

3. **Optical Path:**
   - **Convex Lens**: Focuses the light beam for precise traversal through optical layers.
   - **Silver Mirror**: Redirects the light in the closed-loop system for repeated passes through the filtering layers.

4. **Filtering Layers:**
   - **LCD-Based or Electro-Optical Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs):** Act as the programmable filters. Each layer diffracts or passes photons based on a pixel-specific transmission pattern.
   - **KDP (Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate):** A material used in some layers for electro-optic modulation, achieving higher frequencies than LCDs.
   - **NEMS (Nano-Electromechanical Systems) Mirror Array:** Enhances the control over light redirection or filtering precision.

5. **Enclosure:**
   - A **Square Internally Reflective Case** ensures minimal light loss and consistent photon recycling within the computational loop.

### **Operational Design**
- **Input and Loop:**
   1. Laser light enters from the top of the device.
   2. The beam passes through a series of stacked filtering layers.
   3. Filters are programmed to selectively pass or diffract photons based on the desired computation.

- **Filtering and Feedback:**
   - After passing through the filters, the light is reflected back into the stack by the silver mirror.
   - The process is repeated for thousands of iterations to accumulate computational effects encoded in the photon diffraction patterns.

- **Computation and Output:**
   - After the loop, the photon beam is diverted to the CCD sensor.
   - The complex norms of the light are measured, capturing the computational result.

### **Design Features**
1. **Layer Stack:**
   - Layers are grouped into **Booster Layers** (to amplify computational effects) and **Filter Layers** (to encode specific operations).
   - Layers are based on materials capable of high-speed modulation (e.g., **ITO-Sandwiched KDP** for MHz+ performance).

2. **Token Identification:**
   - The system uses pulse-train patterns (one-hot pulse train) and Fourier modes for "counting" bits, enabling frequency-domain computation.

3. **Modulation Speed:**
   - LCDs provide fine-grain control but operate at slower speeds (~1kHz).
   - Future iterations may implement high-frequency solutions like electro-optic KDP or MEMS-based alternatives to achieve >10 MHz control rates.

---

### **Challenges**
1. **Modulation Speed:**
   - Current LCD technology is too slow (1kHz) for the desired 10+ MHz operation. Alternatives such as ITO-sandwiched KDP or other electro-optic materials are under consideration.
2. **Photon Recycling:**
   - Ensuring minimal loss of photon energy during repeated iterations in the loop.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Development of custom high-frequency filters using advanced materials like **ITO-KDP**.
2. Exploration of faster switching elements, including MEMS mirrors and electro-optic polymers.
3. Scaling to larger filter arrays (e.g., 1000x1000 pixels per layer) for increased computational density.

This design provides a foundational layout for a high-performance light-based computing system, combining advanced optics with cutting-edge materials for unprecedented processing speeds.
