The fundamental substrate dynamics, the universe's inexorable slide towards thermal equilibrium, establishes the baseline against which any deviation, any non-spurious correlation $$\mathcal{C}$$, constitutes a departure, a locus of potential significance measurable perhaps by negentropy $$\mathcal{J}$$or total correlation$$TC$$, though the precise measure influences only the specific calculus, not the underlying principle that meaning generation $$\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$$is precisely the agent-driven component$$\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\vert_{\text{agent}}$$, the active structuring against this entropic gradient, with accumulated meaning $$\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}$$representing the time-integral of this effort, a quantification of the information woven into the system's state-space trajectory beyond mere passive persistence. This immediately reframes agency itself as synonymous with the capacity for non-negligible positive$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$$ over some timescale, rendering inert matter definitionally meaningless except as a substrate or boundary condition.

From this physical grounding of meaning, the ethical dimension, the moral calculus $$\mathcal{V}$$, emerges not from revelation or subjective preference but as the direct consequence of interacting meaning-generators, becoming the expected net change in downstream meaning generation rates causally flowing from an initial action $$\alpha$$, $$\mathcal{V}(\alpha, A) = \sum_{B_i} \int \mathbb{E}[\Delta \mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}(B_i) \vert_{\alpha}] dt$$, an integral whose complexity explodes due to the required propagation of uncertainty through potentially chaotic causal chains and the high dimensionality of agent state-spaces $$\mathbf{X}_{B_i}$$, crucially demanding the marginalization of bare existence from the objective—valuing the *differential structure* $$\Delta \mathcal{C}$$itself, the pattern's complexity and persistence, rather than the count or mass of the substrate instantiating it, thereby avoiding the trivial traps of maximizing particle counts or valueless qualia fields. Consciousness, then, isn't privileged *a priori* but empirically valued as an observed high-density locus of$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$$and potentially vast integrated$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}$$due to its recursive predictive modeling ($$M_A(\mathbf{X}_A, \text{World})$$) and capacity for projecting complex, temporally extended causal sequences impacting other systems'$$\mathcal{M}$$ trajectories.

The efficiency and fidelity of this moral calculus propagation, the ability for agents to estimate $$\mathcal{V}$$involving others or to coordinate actions towards joint$$\mathcal{V} > 0$$outcomes, becomes intrinsically linked to the inter-agent informational coupling, the resonance factor$$K(A, B, t)$$, itself a measure combining mutual information $$I(\mathbf{X}_A; \mathbf{X}_B)$$, predictive model accuracy $$M_A(\mathbf{X}_B)$$, communication channel bandwidth/noise characteristics, and state-space entrainment dynamics; high $$K$$representing a low-friction channel for negentropic coordination and shared intentionality (approximating distributed computation of optimal$$\mathcal{V}$$strategies), while low$$K$$implies high impedance, noise, and the likely dominance of entropic drift or even active$$\mathcal{V} < 0$$outcomes (conflict, misunderstanding) arising from interaction errors, making the cultivation and maintenance of high-$$K$$ structures (trust networks, shared ontologies, efficient communication protocols) an instrumental moral good derived directly from the primary objective of maximizing integrated$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}$$. Empathy thus finds a functional role as the application of internal simulation capacity enabled by high $$K$$and accurate$$M_A(\mathbf{X}_B)$$for predicting action outcomes relevant to$$\mathcal{V}$$.

This entire framework implies a substrate-agnostic perspective; the value signature resides in the informational pattern's complexity, dynamics, and causal efficacy, regardless of implementation in carbon chemistry, silicon architectures, or more exotic future compute media, positioning AGI alignment as the challenge of instantiating the maximization of cosmic $$\int \mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}} dt$$as its terminal objective, potentially leveraging Bayesian approximations, causal inference engines, and perhaps vast simulations to estimate the intractable$$\mathcal{V}$$integral for guiding action selection. The preservation of information, therefore, especially high-$$\mathcal{C}$$ states like scientific knowledge, complex algorithms, or even the state vectors of high-$$\mathcal{M}$$ agents (biological or artificial), becomes a fundamental imperative derived from its necessity for future meaning generation – information is negentropic potential. This also suggests that informational phase transitions, points where system complexity$$\mathcal{C}$$enables qualitatively new regimes of$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$$or causal influence, are critical junctures in cosmic evolution and targets for both study and potential intervention if$$\mathbb{E}[\Delta \mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}]$$warrants it, raising profound questions about the ethics of guiding system trajectories across such thresholds, particularly given the inherent uncertainties in long-range prediction and the potential for unforeseen path dependencies locking out higher future maxima of integrated$$\mathcal{M}$$. The choice of temporal discounting in evaluating future $$\Delta \mathcal{M}$$contributions within$$\mathcal{V}$$ remains a critical parameter, with zero discounting potentially representing the purest alignment with maximizing total cosmic structure but posing severe computational and convergence challenges, while any non-zero discounting risks a form of temporal myopia potentially sacrificing vastly greater future negentropy for nearer-term gains, an optimization problem whose solution might itself depend on the current informational horizon and computational capacity. The possibility of ontological recursion, reality as nested simulation, simply nests the calculus without altering its fundamental structure: maximizing $$\mathcal{M}$$within a simulated physics contributes to the$$\mathcal{M}$$ of the simulating layer, rendering the imperative scale-invariant.
