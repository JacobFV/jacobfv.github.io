My family places strong value on learning, kindness, and integrity. My dad spent much of my childhood as a systems engineer at Microsoft, and my mom, as a minister.[^1] Passing their values on, my siblings and I enjoyed regular visits to the library, lively conversations about science and engineering, and hours of creative play and programming with [LEGO Mindstorm robots](https://jacobfvaldez.weebly.com/engineering.html#robot-arm).

I was the school nerd: making toy VB6 programs in 5th grade, spending free time in middle school [designing CNC's, robots, and other machines](https://jacobfvaldez.weebly.com/engineering.html#cookie-baker), and studying Calculus III during 9th grade Spanish class. To pass the time in Algebra II, I wrote a 3D rocket trajectory simulator on the school's TI-84 calculator. While many of the seniors huddled over their calculators computing chemistry lab analyses by hand, I was the junior passing out CD's containing my ['Lab-a-tron'](https://github.com/JacobFV/Labatron) homework helper. Although not on the normal degree plan, my school paid the community college for me to take several [advanced math classes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-f-valdez/details/education/684314036/multiple-media-viewer/?treasuryMediaId=1635457262226) (Calculus I, II, III, and Ordinary Differential Equations) in my senior year, during which time I also organised a [43-person lab group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-RuFKsP7IP62rds0wKVZtwxE967y3uDoQWFtmfhcWxQ/edit?usp=sharing) spanning three sections of dual credit biology.

Outside school, I spent time fueling my passion for science and engineering with hours of reading, experiments, designing, and making. At various times, water electrolysis units, [robotic arms](https://jacobfvaldez.weebly.com/engineering.html#robot-arm), and [tests tubes of fungus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X6at4PVSOuUvA3cJ3Pr43qJvMiOzENta/view?usp=sharing) littered our room. After seeing the Makerbot Thing-O-Matic 3D printer at the age of 12, I fell in love with engineering and would often spend after-hours in the garage making sparks fly. Two years later, I (finally) discovered the programming world outside Microsoft, which in my case, started with [web 1.0 programming](https://jacobfv.github.io/projects/copyright_calculator/) and later included Python. After graduating, I got active in a full time ministry while working part time. Later that year, I stumbled across [`arxiv.org`](https://arxiv.org), started reading the papers, and fell into the `let's create AI' black hole. I'm still there, and if I get to meet you, I hope to pull you in!
