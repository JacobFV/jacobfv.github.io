Jacob Valdez. Human. I build stuff.

Started programming VB6 when I was 10. Branched out over the years: [C#](https://github.com/JacobFV/Sale), [HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/JacobFV/Copyright-Calculator), [Arduino](https://jacobfv123.medium.com/cookie-cutter-cnc-923c68932ee6), [Python](https://github.com/JacobFV/jnumpy), [TypeScript](https://www.mitwa.ai/), [AWS](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2021/rtc-jupyterlab-in-the-cloud/), [Android](https://jacobfv.github.io/projects/desparados-a-eye/), etc. etc. Did lots of [engineering projects](https://jacobfvaldez.weebly.com/) too. Also, lots of independant study; glad I did Cal I-III and DiffEq when I was 17, which helped a ton with the DL math. Stumbled across [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) by accident in 2018 and fell in love with AI. Saw the future, and read ave. 1+ paper/day for 3 years following. Went back to school for CS in 2020; graduated Summer 2022. Spent the rest of 2022 as a SwE at Motio. Left to work on a full-scale humanoid robot, but then realized many important components of the robotics ecosystem were missing, so I started a [general purpose robotics kit](https://limboid.ai).

Still iterating on the BoidKit, but now I'm also using it to build a $1,000 full-scale general-purpose humanoid robot (actually it was $526 last time I checked the BOM in 2024, no including shipping and tax). This is the most important project of my entire life. I talk about it on all my socials. If you have any love for science, technology, engineering, innovation, product development, etc., etc., please [reach out](https://jacobfv.github.io/bio#contact) about working together.

**Update** (9-25-2024): I'm working with the [Simp4Satoshi](https://x.com/iamgingertrash) to build the [Truffle AI Computer](https://x.com/itsalltruffles). Its a mixture of hardware, software, and mle plus adjacent stuff. It's such an amazing place to use the CAD skills I've learned on a product that millions of people will look at. 'full stack' product engineering from the hands on soldering to programming to meeting prospects, 7/11-16 scheudles, jam sessions, vibes, <s>we're really living a movie here</s>. I'll be here until we get to a good point and then I want to return to the Human Robot along with [gohuman.fund](https://gohuman.fund) (website last updated months ago but i've still been deploying/mentoring; we're currently starting a hacker house in Nigerea) and [humanworker.ai](https://humanworker.ai) (wip). 

**Update** (4-28-2025): I left Truffles after the launch in December to build [commandAGI](https://commandagi.com): it was going to be a command center for managing your AGIs (they're here afaict) and it would eventually become a peice of critical infrastructure to keep humanity holding the leash. Raised 30k for 5% on paper but the angel defaulted on his terms and I ended up looking for work. I'm grateful that one of my commits on some random open-source repo was found by [Saul Fuhrmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saul-fuhrmann-775a0b159/) around that time and he invited me to work with Breezy. We're building AI phone receptionist and business tech for soloprenuers (primarily nontechnical field contractors). SF is really nice and I've met so many interesting people here. I belong here so bad. I'm really grateful to be able to contribute here.

The GoHuman fund had to shutter bec money. I had never taken raising LPs seriously so that's on me; it was all personally financed. still, i've been really inspired by the people GoHuman supported: [Advik Kooper](https://x.com/heyadvikkapoor) went on to [raise an undisclosed (large) amount of money](https://x.com/heyadvikkapoor/status/1869838263164514363) from Peter Theil's [1517](https://www.1517fund.com/) division for his teenage/prodigy funding solana platform [Exerton](http://exerton.xyz). [Sur Naik](https://x.com/sur_naik) went on to [secure a $20,000 grant](https://x.com/GoHumanFund/status/1892266967056470268) from [Emergent Ventures](https://x.com/emergent_vc) to continue building his electronics prototyping system. [Emma Obadoni](https://x.com/EObadoni) built the 50+ member Tech Family which has helped teach many Nigerians and other Africans about technology and how to work in the industry and helped a few get jobs in tech. And there are so many others GoHuman supported that are up-and-coming in their fields:  [Pablo Perez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-cobo-b46a8128b/) in ML, Khadija Ech-Challoey in Physics, (a dozen others waiting to be named)... I am so proud of them all!

**Update** (10-27-2025): I met [Diego Caples](https://x.com/diegocaples) and [Atharva](https://x.com/_gundawar) at Weavehack's Oct 11-12 [Self-Evolving Agents Hackathon](https://luma.com/weavehacks2?tk=iDsItS) where [my team made the finalists for building a very primitive GPU-based browser to accelerate computer-use agent data collection](https://x.com/wandb/status/1978200052356301237) and shortly thereafter joined Diego and Atharva at [The AGI Company](https://www.theagi.company/) engineering our computer-use agent API. [It had always been one of my clearer visions and dreams as a 19-22yo to build multimodal computer use agents that operate across an ever expanding scope of operation](https://github.com/ComputaCo/computatrum-nn) and now it seems like I'll actually be helping bring this to world! :D
