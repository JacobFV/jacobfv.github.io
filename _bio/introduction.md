Jacob Valdez. Human. I build stuff.

Started programming VB6 when I was 10. Branched out over the years: [C#](https://github.com/JacobFV/Sale), [HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/JacobFV/Copyright-Calculator), [Arduino](https://jacobfv123.medium.com/cookie-cutter-cnc-923c68932ee6), [Python](https://github.com/JacobFV/jnumpy), [TypeScript](https://www.mitwa.ai/), [AWS](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/2021/rtc-jupyterlab-in-the-cloud/), [Android](https://jacobfv.github.io/projects/desparados-a-eye/), etc. etc. Did lots of [engineering projects](https://jacobfvaldez.weebly.com/) too. Also, lots of independant study; glad I did Cal I-III and DiffEq when I was 17, which helped a ton with the DL math. Stumbled across [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) by accident in 2018 and fell in love with AI. Saw the future, and read ave. 1+ paper/day for 3 years following. Went back to school for CS in 2020; graduated Summer 2022. Spent the rest of 2022 as a SwE at Motio. Left to work on a full-scale humanoid robot, but then realized many important components of the robotics ecosystem were missing, so I started a [general purpose robotics kit](https://limboid.ai/boidkit).

Still iterating on the BoidKit, but now I'm also using it to finally build my $1,000 full-scale general-purpose [humanoid robot](https://humanrobots.ai) (actually it was $526 last time I checked the BOM, no including shipping and tax). This is the most important project of my entire life. I talk about it on all my socials. If you have any love for science, technology, engineering, innovation, product development, etc., etc., please [reach out](https://jacobfv.github.io/bio#contact) about joining the team.

**Update** (9-25-2024): I'm working with the [Simp4Satoshi](https://x.com/iamgingertrash) to build the [Truffle AI Computer](https://x.com/itsalltruffles). Its a mixture of hardware, software, and mle plus adjacent stuff. It's such an amazing place to use practically everything I've learned on a product that will impact millions of people. 'full stack' product engineering from the hands on soldering to programming to meeting prospects, 7/11-16 scheudles, jam sessions, vibes, we're really living a movie here. I'll be here until we get to a good point and then I want to return to the Human Robot along with [gohuman.fund](https://gohuman.fund) (website last updated months ago but i've still been deploying/mentoring; we're currently starting a hacker house in Nigerea) and [humanworker.ai](https://humanworker.ai) (wip). 

**Update** (4-28-2025): I left Truffles after the launch in December to build my own startup [commandAGI](https://commandagi.com): it was going to be a command center for managing your AGIs (they're here afaict) and it would eventually become a peice of critical infrastructure to keep humanity holding the leash. Raised 30k for 5% on paper but the angel defaulted on his terms and I ended up looking for work. I'm grateful to have met [Saul]() around that time and he invited me to a trial with Breezy. Everything vibed and now I'm a SwE #2! We're building AI buisness managmeent software; think vibe-coding but for the nontechnical side of SMB. SF is really nice and I've met so many interesting people here. I belong here so bad. I'm really grateful to be able to contribute here.

The GoHuman fund had to shutter bec money. I had never taken raising LPs seriously so that's on me; it was all personally financed. still, i've been really inspired by the people GoHuman supported: [Advik Kooper](https://x.com/heyadvikkapoor) went on to [raise an undisclosed (large) amount of money](https://x.com/heyadvikkapoor/status/1869838263164514363) from Peter Theil's [1517](https://www.1517fund.com/) division for his teenage/prodigy funding solana platform [Exerton](http://exerton.xyz). [Sur Naik](https://x.com/sur_naik) went on to [secure a $20,000 grant](https://x.com/GoHumanFund/status/1892266967056470268) from [Emergent Ventures](https://x.com/emergent_vc) to continue building his electronics prototyping system. [Emma Obadoni](https://x.com/EObadoni) built the 50+ member Tech Family which has helped teach many Nigerians and other Africans about technology and how to work in the industry and helped a few get jobs in tech. And there are so many others GoHuman supported that are up-and-coming in their fields:  [Pablo Perez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-cobo-b46a8128b/) in ML, Khadija Challoey in Physics, (a dozen others i cannot publicly name yet)... I am so proud of you all! I can't beleive they even let me meet them tbh
