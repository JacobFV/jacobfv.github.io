ABSTRACT
Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first
condition is the simulation of a reality or generative world model, which determines what can be
known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the
world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a
selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is
the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop —
in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) — the world model contains the knowledge that it exists.
This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and
continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model
for precision-control across the entire hierarchy, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and
control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. This Beautiful Loop
Theory is deeply revealing about meditation, psychedelic, and altered states, minimal phenomenal
experience, and provides a new vision for conscious artificial intelligence.

INTRODUCTION

Consciousness is perhaps the biggest mystery in science. At a certain point, most fields of inquiry find that
the strange capacity of organisms to experience cannot be overlooked. Books, articles, and media discussing
the nature of consciousness abound, with unique perspectives emerging from psychologists, neuroscientists,
philosophers, phenomenologists, computer scientists, biologists, physicists, and contemplatives. Yet, most
would agree that consciousness remains an inconvenient enigma in a world that otherwise seems reducible
to things, objects, patterns, and equations.
Equally, it is clear that the tools of science can reveal something about the nature of consciousness.
Thousands of experiments attest that consciousness has predictable characteristics, predictable correlates,
and fluctuates under predictable conditions (Koch et al., 2016; Frith, 2021). Thanks to this growing
evidence base, an array of impressive theories of consciousness (ToCs) have emerged in recent years
(Rosenthal, 2000; Seth & Bayne, 2022; Carruthers, 2017; Tononi, 2008; Baars, 2005). These theories have
many strengths and explanatory power but a general consensus in the scientific community does not exist.
Even the metaphysical assumptions underlying the science of consciousness still result in fierce debates
(Kuhn, 2024; Fleming et al., 2023; Kastrup, 2008).
Here, we aim to contribute to these theories by building on a promising general theory of organisms,
known as active inference or predictive processing, under the free energy principle (Friston, 2010; Clark,
2013; Hohwy, 2013; Seth & Tsakiris, 2018). Several others have proposed that active inference may
provide solutions to different features of conscious experience (e.g., Hohwy, 2022; Hohwy & Seth, 2020;
Safron, 2020; 2022; Carhart-Harris et al. 2014; Rudrauf et al. 2017; Friston, 2018; Williford et al. 2018;
Clark, 2019; Kanai et al., 2019; Chang et al. 2020; Deane, 2021; Whyte & Smith, 2021; Whyte et al., 2024).
Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether active inference can satisfy the conditions for a ToC. Yet others
have proposed that we should think of active inference as providing “...theories for consciousness science,
rather than ToCs per se” (Seth & Bayne, 2022, p. 446). The question arises, what conditions would active
inference need to satisfy in order to cross the ToC threshold? Why is it that the theory is so successful in
explaining perception, cognition, and action, but not consciousness itself?
To address these questions, we propose three conditions that seem necessary for consciousness and
show how some active inference systems satisfy them. The first condition is a generative world model, or
epistemic field. This provides the ‘space’ or contents that can be known, hence the term epistemic
(Metzinger, 2020). The second condition is inferential competition, which determines what becomes
conscious and why it is coherent (i.e., addressing the binding problem). The third and final condition is
epistemic depth, which refers to the fact that the epistemic field is recursively, and widely (i.e., deeply)
shared throughout the system. As we will see, this idea has some similar characteristics to “broadcasting”
(Dehaene et al., 2003), “information integration” (Tononi, 2008), and “fame in the brain” (Dennett, 2001),
albeit with important differences.
Below, we will introduce one condition at a time. We will then show how active inference can provide
a parsimonious explanation for a range of cognitive processes and states of consciousness when these
conditions are satisfied. Our view also implies that the most basal or minimal form of awareness is a highly
simplified (nearly contentless) world model knowing itself non-locally. Therefore, a first person

2

perspective, self-modeling, and agency, are not prerequisites of awareness, but are rather local or
“contracted” forms of consciousness (Metzinger, 2020).
To be concise, we will avoid an extensive literature review (see Seth & Bayne, 2022; Frith, 2021; or
Lau, 2022 for reviews on ToCs). However, as noted above, many features of the theory (reviewed in Table
2 of the discussion) are consistent with elements of other ToCs such as Global Neuronal Workspace Theory
(GNWT, Dehaene et al., 2003), Higher Order Theories (HOT, Lau and Rosenthal, 2011), Recurrent
Processing Theory (RPT, Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000; Pennartz et al., 2019) and Integrated Information
Theory (IIT, Tononi, 2008). Links with existing theories will be made throughout. The strength of our
approach will be in showing how the interactions of a minimal set of computational assumptions within
active inference may provide the ingredients for consciousness, with implications for understanding various
states from lucid dreaming to meditation, to psychedelics, as well as artificial intelligence.

SIMULATING A REALITY MODEL

In order to move about in a world and keep ourselves alive, we need a model of that world. One could
not walk, jump, pick up a glass, catch a ball, or give a hug, without a simulation of the unfolding present.
Achieving such a coherent model of reality is an immense feat, especially considering that the brain has to
deal with unpredictable, imprecise and often incoherent data (Treisman, 1996). Yet, somehow, our
experience of reality seems to make sense—it has depth, color, shape, thought, emotion, people, and objects
that we seem to understand and predict with relative ease. Notably, there can also be an awareness of the
contents of this world model. We experience the catching of the ball, the texture of grass under our feet,
and the warm embrace. Our world appears to be alive.
We term this ‘experienced world’, which is the organism’s entire lived reality, the generative
phenomenal, unified world model (hereafter simply reality model). It is generative because processes
internal to the organism play a central role in constructing or generating the ‘output’ of the model. It is
phenomenal because there can be an experience of the reality model—it constitutes our lived world. And it
is unified because it is coherent or appears to be ‘bound’ together as a whole. This reality model is also an
epistemic field because it is a place (or flow of sensations) that can be known, explored, interrogated, and
updated—a kind of affordance for action, both physical and mental (Metzinger, 2017). Our model of reality
tells us what is possible and what is not possible, what will keep us alive and what will harm us, and even
what we ourselves are. We take such a model to be a necessary condition for consciousness because it
defines what can become conscious, be known, or experienced.
Active inference provides a straightforward solution to — or description of — how organisms construct
a reality model apt for their lived world (Friston, 2006; 2010). Various details of this theory will be
introduced later; here, it is sufficient to lay out a few of the key tenets. Active inference can be derived from
two codependent assumptions: (1) the imperative for biological systems to maintain a boundary between
themselves and the environment (i.e., existence), and (2) the necessity to remain in a specific set of
(characteristic) states compatible with continued existence (i.e., adaptive actions). From these premises, we
can construct a framework where existence necessitates a generative model of the self and environment,
allowing the system to resolve surprising sensations — i.e., homeostasis — and anticipate surprising

3

outcomes and maintain themselves through adaptive action, i.e., allostasis. In order to learn and update the
model, organisms reduce prediction errors, or uncertainty1. Or flipped around, the organism persists by
seeking evidence for its own existence, i.e., self-evidencing (Hohwy, 2016). Minimizing prediction errors—
the difference between top-down predictions and input—simultaneously improves the model's accuracy
and guides the system towards preferred, livable, states that are characteristic of the kind of thing it is.
The key innovation of active inference lies in treating action selection as an inference problem, where
policies (sequences of actions) are selected to minimize expected uncertainty (i.e., surprises in the future
consequent on a policy). In order to handle the separation of temporal scales in real-world environments —
and to balance present-moment expectations with future needs — the generative model is almost universally
hierarchical, with higher levels encoding more abstract and longer-term predictions. For example,
soundwaves can be abstracted into phonemes, which can be abstracted into syllables, and then into words,
sentences, biographies, and so on (Baltzell et al., 2019; Dehaene et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2015; Taylor et
al., 2015; Friston et al., 2024; Friston et al., 2017; George and Hawkins, 2009). This formulation allows for
deep narratives about our experiences and our bodies across time, as well as goal-directed behavior, to
emerge from the fundamental drive to maintain existence.
Finally, the prediction errors that report the degree of surprise — and thereby drive Bayesian belief
updating at each hierarchical level — are precision-weighted (Feldman & Friston, 2010). Precision
modulates the impact of prediction errors on belief updating and policy selection by controlling the gain on
error units. High precision amplifies the influence of prediction errors, while low precision attenuates them.
This precision-weighting mechanism allows the system to flexibly adapt to different contexts by modulating
the balance between sensory evidence and prior beliefs. Put simply, we need to know what we know but
also how confident we are about it. In some cases, we can trust our beliefs, in other cases we need to focus
on learning something new from the world (Friston et al., 2015). On this reading, world models are
‘precision engineered’, where increasing the precision of certain prediction errors can be understood in
terms of attending to their source.
One of the advantages of active inference is that it can act as a bridge between first and third-person
approaches (cf. the explanatory gap, Levine, 1983). In other words, computational approaches like active
inference offer a middle-way between subjective experience and neural mechanisms, providing mechanistic
insight into both (see Figure 1). This approach is sometimes called computational neurophenomenology
(Suzuki et al., 2022; Sandved-Smith et al., 2021; 2024; Ramstead et al., 2022) because it bridges subjective
experience and objective neural processes within a single modeling framework. Specifically, it uses
generative models to specify how the brain infers and constructs experiential content, allowing researchers
to link changes in neural dynamics (the “algorithmic descriptions”) to the qualities and structure of
phenomenological experience. By systematically mapping both first-person reports and neural dynamics to
underlying computational processes, we simultaneously gain an explanatory account of how subjective
experience arises and a mechanistic understanding of how the brain implements it.

Note. This figure illustrates the explanatory gap between neural mechanisms and subjective experience. Hierarchical active
inference (the cone in the middle) acts as a bridge between these two—first and third person—approaches to knowledge. The cone
also provides a schematic overview of how a reality or world model can be constructed through a process of hierarchical precisionweighted prediction-error minimization (i.e., active inference). At the lowest level (dark blue), the organism encounters input from
various systems, including the five senses as well as interoceptive, proprioceptive, visceromotor, immune, neuroendocrine, and
gustatory systems. Through a continuous interaction — between top-down expectations and bottom-up prediction errors — the
system constructs increasingly abstract and temporally deep representations giving rise to the self, world, thoughts, action plans,
feelings, emotions, imagination, and everything else. As a primer for the next section, the cone also depicts how ‘binding’ may be
occurring at various levels of the hierarchy, from low level features, to objects, to global multimodal and transmodal binding of the
different parallel systems. Not depicted here is the fact that this hierarchical process is constantly tested and confirmed through
action (e.g., top-down attention, physical movement, or reasoning).

Given the above, it appears that active inference can account for the capacity to simulate a pragmatic
model of reality (i.e., a reality model that provides an epistemic field for adaptive action). Indeed, generating
such a model is at the heart of active inference because without it the organism fails to anticipate preferred
states and therefore maintain their boundaries — and bodies (Barrett, 2020). A growing evidence base
suggests that active inference is, or at least could be, what the brain and body are doing (Walsh et al., 2020;
Hohwy, 2013). Active inference therefore satisfies our first condition for consciousness, i.e., the generation
of a world or reality model. This suggests that active inference may at least explain what is known or
experienced. However, it does not yet explain the why or how of consciousness.

INFERENTIAL COMPETITION AND BAYESIAN BINDING

Any theory of consciousness must explain why we become aware of some phenomena but not others.
Active inference and predictive coding have provided impressive accounts of how particular contents of
consciousness are constructed (particularly in the visual stream, Peelen et al., 2024). But as yet, there is no
generally accepted account of what determines the selective threshold required for awareness (Seth &
Bayne, 2022; Baars, 2005; Kouider & Dehaene, 2007). Some informative efforts in this general direction
exist (Saffron, 2020; 2022; Friston, 2018; Hohwy, 2012; Dołęga & Dewhurst, 2021).
Consider the familiar case of binocular rivalry (Breese, 1909; Tong et al., 2006). Here, a different image
is presented to each eye at the same retinal location at the same time (e.g., a face is presented to the left eye,
and a house is presented to the right eye). This results in a bizarre situation where the brain cannot seem to
accept the fact of the two opposing visual realities. The resulting experience is a gradual switch between a
house or a face, or a mix of the two. Such experiments highlight that some sort of selection process is taking
place, which makes some configuration or interpretation of the senses conscious and not others (Hohwy et
al., 2008; Hohwy, 2012). There are countless examples that raise a similar conundrum, including
inattentional blindness (Mack, 2003; Kouider & Dehaene, 2007), visual and sensory illusions (Eagleman,
2008; Laukkonen & Tangen, 2017), as well as introspective, cognitive, and behavioral confabulations
(Nisbett & Schachter, 1966; Nisbett & Wilson, 1977; Maier, 1931; Wegner, 2002; Weiskrantz, 1986).
While there are clearly some things that become conscious and others that do not, this pertains less to
the harder problems of consciousness than one might think (Chalmers, 1995). Consider that regardless of
which percept becomes conscious during binocular rivalry, we are always nevertheless (meta) aware of
what enters our visual field. In other words, the presence of consciousness has not changed, only the
contents. We can also be aware of the fact that our experience is changing from the face to the house, and
even perhaps aware of why it is changing.
What is somehow central is therefore the fact that there seems to be a “space” wherein there is
something it is like to feel, perceive, and crucially, know the contents of mind (Metzinger, 2020).
Cleeremans et al (2020) put this same point differently: “...someone is aware of some state of affairs not
merely when she is sensitive to that state of affairs, but rather when she knows that she is sensitive to that
state of affairs.” [our emphasis]. When encountering a visual illusion, rivalry, or an ambiguous stimulus,
we seem capable of knowing that we are having such and such experience. In the parlance of
phenomenology, we experience ‘seeing’ and phenomenological transparency gives way to opacity
(Limanowski and Friston, 2018; Metzinger, 2003). This experiential space seems to be unified, coherent,
and bound together: a conscious gestalt, as others have noted (Baars et al., 2013; Tononi et al. 2005, 2008).
Hence, consciousness has a certain conclusive nature to it, as if the brain and body have found a global and
unified affordance within which it can have a self, move about, attend to things, feel emotions; and crucially,
keep the body alive (Barrett, 2020; Seth, 2013).
Here, we propose that the threshold for consciousness—what enters this epistemic field or reality
model—is determined through a process of competition among possible explanations of the causes of one’s
sensations. Moreover, we suggest that the so-called binding “problem” may in fact be part of the “solution”

6

as to what breaches the threshold for consciousness. That is, coherence and boundedness are a central
criterion in winning the inferential competition. Metaphorically, the competition for consciousness has
goalposts in the shape of coherence and unification. If an inference is incoherent with other parallel and
hierarchically adjacent inferences throughout the system, then it is less likely to be selected2.
This coherence criterion also falls out naturally from a system that aims to reduce uncertainty or
prediction-errors. Dissonance between inferences is equivalent to confusion—a generative model that does
not parsimoniously explain the data. Such confounding explanations result in irreducible error propagation.
The pressure for coherence is foregrounded by the fact that the remit of the reality model is to reduce
uncertainty for adaptive action (Nave et al., 2020). If the epistemic field is internally incoherent, uncertainty
accumulates as we evaluate policies or paths into the future, rendering action selection imprecise and their
outcomes uncertain (i.e., surprising on average).
Specifically, we hypothesize that coherence and binding naturally fall out of a system that engages in
hierarchical Bayesian inference (Knill & Pouget, 2004). What drives selection as to what gets bound into
the field of experience is a precision-weighted competition between possible explanations for the causes of
sensory data (i.e., a kind of competition for ‘fame in the brain’, Dennett, 1995; 2001). Crucially, what wins
the precision-weighting competition is partially driven by the contents that best cohere with the existing
reality model (i.e., priors), which provides the necessary constraints, or inducted biases (technically,
empirical priors), for what can be assimilated into the epistemic field. In Bayesian terms, incoherent or
incongruous data is either imprecise—in which case the associated prediction errors would be endowed
with less precision—or unexplainable—in which case, precision weighting would preferentially select
those data that can be explained. We illustrate this process of Bayesian binding using an example of microbinding in a face percept (Figure 2). We argue that the same idea can be extended to macro-binding under
the reality model.

Note. This figure illustrates a simplified process of Bayesian binding in the context of face perception. The diagram shows how
noisy sensory input is combined with prior expectations to produce a clear posterior representation under a generative model. Left:
The sensory data shows a low-precision (noisy) input image of a face where details are not easily discernible. Top left: The prior
is represented as a high-level abstract face shape, indicating the brain's pre-existing expectation of what a face looks like (inspired
by Lee & Mumford, 2003). NB: In reality, the generative model has many levels, representing a continuous range of abstraction.
Center: The generative model uses the prior P(v) to generate predicted features (v) that are combined with the sensory data (u) to
produce prediction errors (u-û), that together inform a posterior. Center Right: The posterior is the output of the generative model,
showing a clearer, more detailed face image. This represents the brain's inference after combining prior expectations with sensory
evidence. The equation illustrates a precision-weighted Bayesian binding process in a simplified unidimensional case assuming
only Gaussian probability distributions. It shows how the posterior mean (μ_posterior) is a weighted combination of the prior mean
(μ_prior) and the sensory data (μ_data), with weights determined by their respective relative precisions (π). This figure illustrates
a key principle of Bayesian binding: a conscious percept or “thing” arises from the brain's attempt to create a coherent, unified
explanation (the posterior) for its sensory inputs by combining them with prior expectations through hierarchical Bayesian
inference. On the right, we also provide an intuitive monochrome visual illustration of feature binding in vision wherein low level
visual feature patches are bound into face features like eyes, noses and mouths, and then how these features are bound into faces.

Bayesian binding also offers a novel description of ignition as defined in GNWT (Dehaene &
Changeux, 2011; Dehaene et al., 2014; Friston et al., 2012). Ignition refers to the sudden and widespread
activation of a coalition of neurons that “ignites” information into conscious awareness. In GNWT, this
process is characterized by a nonlinear transition from local, specialized processing to global availability
of information across the brain. According to Bayesian binding, the ignition threshold is driven by precision
competition throughout the hierarchy, wherein precisions are also constrained by coherence (top-down)
with the reality model (i.e., predicted precision3 is higher if it has local and global coherence). Ignition,

3

The factors that drive precision are manifold, including salience, top-down attention, context contingencies,
coherence, uncertainty, confidence, reward, neuromodulators, and previous learning more generally. Moreover, topdown attention can “magnify” particular layers or contents within the hierarchy by increasing their relative
(precision) weighting in the reality model (Feldman & Friston, 2010), e.g., by paying attention to the textured bark
of a particular tree — in the context of a forest scene — the conscious gestalt will be modified by enhancing the
details of the gnarliness of the bark. The low level sensory percepts occupy more ‘bandwidth’ in the epistemic field.

binding, and competition are hence subsumed within active inference (Whyte & Smith, 2021). They are
each the natural consequence of a system that reduces uncertainty with sufficient complexity and depth.
A complimentary view (cf. Whyte & Smith, 2021; Whyte et al., 2024) proposes that consciousness
arises specifically at the interface between continuous sensory perception and discrete, counterfactual
policy selection processes. Here, conscious contents correspond to precise posterior beliefs about the hidden
states of the world, body, or brain, which are temporally abstracted from immediate sensory fluctuations
and sufficiently precise to drive action selection, including subjective reports. Thus, conscious states differ
from unconscious ones in their capacity to inform discrete policy decisions, reflecting a computational
balance between goal-directed (exploiting known information) and exploratory (resolving ambiguity and
novelty) imperatives. An integrative perspective may be that Bayesian Binding is a key mechanistic
threshold between continuous sensory perception and discrete, conscious, and precise posteriors for
counterfactual policy selection. That is, Bayesian binding emphasizes that discrete and precise posteriors
(Whyte & Smith et al., 2021) also require local and global coherence, which naturally drives the bounded
and holistic nature of conscious experience.
The key takeaway here is that Bayesian binding is (in theory) at the heart of all experience, from
unimodal processes, multisensory binding, through to global integration. That is, generating experience
demands nested levels of binding, i.e., combining priors and sensory evidence into an approximate posterior
through a hierarchical generative model, where that perceptual synthesis or combination rest sensitively on
the precision or confidence afforded each level of processing (Friston, 2008; Hohwy, 2012; Hohwy, 2013).
The insight is that the same basic mechanism operates at both micro and macro levels. For example, just as
we infer a teapot to be a single ‘thing’ (made of handles, a hollow body, and a spout), we also take our
whole field of experience to be a single thing, which binds together the ground, the sky, our bodies, other
people, and everything else. We hypothesize that this global unified model, however minimal, is necessary
but not sufficient for conscious experience. It is only when this global posterior is reflected back through
the underlying hierarchy that the conditions for consciousness are met. As we will see, explaining the
contents of consciousness is insufficient to capture the imminent and sense of knowing the contents, or
awareness of them.

EPISTEMIC DEPTH AND AWARENESS
“...my own working hypothesis is that consciousness is our inner model of an “epistemic space,”
a space in which possible and actual states of knowledge can be represented. I think that conscious
beings are precisely those who have a model of their own space of knowledge—they are systems
that (in an entirely nonlinguistic and nonconceptual way) know that they currently have the
capacity to know something.”4
-

Metzinger, 2020

4

We generally agree with Metzinger’s (2020; 2024) emphasis on an epistemic “space”, though we prefer the term field because it
highlights that the field and its contents are ‘one’ and always changing.

9

The word epistemic means ‘relating to knowledge’ and the word ‘depth’ refers to both intensity and
the capacity to go below or beyond the surface (Oxford English, 1989). What we mean by the term epistemic
depth is therefore a capacity or continuum (i.e., deepening) of knowing, or awareness, that can be more or
less active (i.e., intense or clear). A state of low epistemic depth is one that involves unclear knowing, such
as states of sleeping, dreaming, or mind-wandering, and a state with high epistemic depth is one that
involves clear or intense knowing, such as mindful or highly aware states (Schooler, 2002; Schooler et al.,
2011). As we will see, the intensity or clarity of knowing can also be directed at the knowing capacity itself,
i.e., reflectively knowing that we know (Dunne et al., 2019; Josipovic, 2019). Our goal in this section is to
deliver a conceptual sense of what we mean by epistemic depth. We then focus on providing a formalization
of this idea in Section 5.
To add some phenomenological nuance to our construct we borrow the term luminosity, which appears
often in the ancient discourses of contemplative traditions (Anālayo 2017), particularly in Mahayana and
Vajrayana Buddhism (Williams, 2013) and Indian philosophy (Skorupski, 2012; Berger, 2015). For our
purposes we define luminosity as the clarity or intensity of knowing or awareness within conscious
experience. Connecting epistemic depth with luminosity has the particular benefit of avoiding an infinite
regress: “as a source of light is never illuminated by another one…” (Bhartṛhari, 1963). Just as a light
shining out of a lamp illuminates the objects but also the lamp itself, ideas of luminosity and self-reflective
awareness often go hand in hand (Williams, 2013). Luminosity and recursion indicate that it is just ‘one’
knowing with varying degrees, just as a light varies in brightness, but is one light. For our purposes,
luminosity provides a useful metaphor—with phenomenological resonance—for the graded nature or
clarity of awareness that seems to be possible for conscious systems.
Now, returning to our construct of the reality model. In this context, luminosity is the degree to which
the reality model (non-locally) knows itself. Within a hierarchical active inference system, the requisite
sharing means that the reality model entails the inference, belief, or expectation, that it exists. By metaphor,
it is as if the system’s output becomes another sensory modality that is recursively distributed back through
all layers of the system. To provide a metaphor: When we speak out loud, we produce sounds and at the
same time hear those sounds and their meaning (i.e., we hear our own voice and what we are saying).
Therefore, our output (voice) is also our input (sound). We sequentially produce form (output) and then
monitor the global context of that form (input) to ensure that our speech communicates a coherent stream
of meaning5. There is a continuous ‘looping’ between what we create through action and what we perceive
through the senses. Similarly, the key output of the inferential process in the brain is the construction of a
reality model that allows us to survive (analogous to the voice). But this global reality model is also an
input to the system and becomes part of the inferential process itself (analogous to the sound, cf. Figure 3).
Consider that while particular contents of the reality model can be confirmed or disconfirmed by new
evidence (e.g., transitions in binocular rivalry), the existence of the reality model is nevertheless receiving
5

A more nuanced treatment of this analogy would call upon sensory attenuation; namely, the attenuation of the
precision of the sensory consequences of self generated outputs. Following action, sensory attenuation is suspended
so that we can attend to the consequences of what we have just done. This is clearly evinced in saccadic eye
movements, where sensory attenuation is known as saccadic suppression, while the sensory attention — during
successive fixations — underwrites epistemic foraging of a visual scene required to construct a perceptual gestalt.

10

continuous validation, regardless of the contents (e.g., all changes confirm that a reality model exists).
Hence, the epistemic field is constantly evidencing its own existence (i.e., field-evidencing). Any action the
organism takes—as little as a saccade, a thought, or a breath—confirms to itself that it (the model) exists.
Indeed, all model (i.e., Bayesian belief) updates confirm it. Hence, the fact that the reality model exists
becomes a precise inference that rarely loses the inferential competition.

compression, information integration, temporal depth, and conceptualization (cf. Figure 1). A weighted combination of features
across the hierarchy are combined or bound together via inferential competition (faded green arrows) to form a global posterior
which is homologous to the reality model (the “conscious cloud” on the top left). This conscious cloud contains diverse perceptual,
sensory, and conceptual elements, connected to corresponding hierarchical levels. Crucially, the reality model is recursively
broadcast back throughout the hierarchy in the form of top-down predictions of both content and context (thick green arrow), where
context is instantiated by predictions of precision. Crucially, predictions of precision weight the prediction errors that underwrite
those predictions in a recursive fashion. This sharing of the reality model fine-tunes inference for binding by upweighting
representations that cohere with it. We hypothesize that this recursion is the causal mechanism permitting epistemic depth (the
sensation of knowing) because the information contained in the reality model loops back into the “conscious cloud” via the implicit
abstraction hierarchy. Hence, the reality model contains information about the existence of itself. While the ‘loop’ is shown to and
from the conscious cloud to illustrate the schema, computationally, all the recursion is within the feedback loops of the central cone
structure: there is no dualism implied in this account.

HYPER-MODELS AND TINY CREATURES

Modeling epistemic depth in a rigorous way calls for a system that not only forms predictions about
external states but also—crucially—models its own modeling recursively at a global scale. One way to
pursue this is through what we term hyper-generative models, or hyper-models for short (Friston, 2010;
Parr & Friston, 2018; Ramstead et al., 2022). In hierarchical active inference, each layer infers hidden
causes in ascending degrees of abstraction. However, to capture epistemic depth, the architecture requires
a truly higher-order (i.e., hyper) model that tracks how each layer’s inferences and precision-weightings
are being deployed system-wide. Formally, we can posit a hyper-parameter set Φ that encodes beliefs about
which layers to trust more (or less) under different contexts, how strongly to up- or down-weight prediction
errors, and how to orchestrate feedback loops across the entire network (Friston et al., 2017). Such a deeply
global parameter permits a system to recursively “rework” and “rediscover” their own modelling processes,
and thus become a truly agentic self-constructing and deconstructing system, reminiscent of the way
humans can intentionally and radically change themselves given the right motivation and context.
Crucially, hyper-parameters that contextualize belief updating—through descending predictions of
precision to lower layers—update the (ascending) precision-weighted prediction errors that update the
hyper-parameters that update (descending) predictions of precision. And so on, ad infinitum. It is this
recursive aspect that equips belief updating with epistemic depth. In terms of phenomenal transparency and
opacity, we can imagine each hierarchical layer as a type of glass that can change its optical properties (cf.
Figure 4). In the setting of epistemic depth, descending predictions of precision render transparent panes of
glass opaque, equipping the hierarchy with the ability to contextualize and select what is broadcast from
one level to the next. In terms of a lamp illuminating itself, epistemic depth offers a very different picture:
a picture more akin to a series of holographic screens (Fields et al., 2021; Fields et al., 2024) illuminating
each other in their reflected light. This picture foregrounds the recursive, non-local and (self) reflective
nature of epistemic depth.
Clarifying how a hyper-parameter set, Φ orchestrates the entire system is a challenge. One possibility
is to define Φ within a factor-graph architecture that includes “hyper-nodes” encoding conditional beliefs
about each sub-model’s precision or reliability (Parr & Friston, 2018). These hyper-nodes would propagate
top-down signals—precision updates, gating directives, or structural reconfigurations—to lower-level
nodes, ensuring that each layer’s inference is shaped by global meta-beliefs. Such a mechanism would allow
simulation of when and how reflective broadcasts occur, enabling comparisons to neurophysiological data
and refining our broader understanding of epistemic depth in biological and artificial systems.
Practically, this kind of architecture has proved useful in modelling brain responses (Iglesias et al.,
2013), using a variant of predictive coding called the hierarchical Gaussian filter (Mathys et al., 2011). In
computational neuroscience, minimal forms of epistemic depth have been used to illustrate attentional
selection and the segregation of figure from ground (Kanai et al., 2015). Technically, the nonlocal aspect
of epistemic depth inherits from the fact that the hyper-parameter—prescribing precisions at every level of
the hierarchy—renders each level part of the hyper-parameter’s Markov blanket (because they are all
children of the hyper-parameter). This mandates recursive message passing between the Bayesian beliefs

12

over hyper-parameters and all levels, in which descending predictions of precision are reflected back in the
form of a prediction error over precision. See Kanai et al., (2015) for the functional form of these secondorder prediction errors in the context of predictive coding architectures.

Note. This diagram illustrates the abstraction hierarchy of features as being composed of layers of ‘smart’ glass which have the
property of being able to change from being transparent (e.g., the layers on the left) to more or less opaque (e.g., the layers on the
right) analogizing phenomenal transparency or opacity of that layer. By analogy, when a pane of glass is opaque, the contents of
our consciousness are known (such as being aware of the feeling of wearing a shirt). On the other hand, when it is transparent, we
do not notice the shirt—like looking through a clean window where we do not notice the glass. To account for this within
hierarchical active inference, we propose the following: The (local) free energy of every layer of the multilayer generative process
is minimized in the usual way, but as a crucial extension, global free energy is minimized in the context of a Global Hyper-Model
which includes a set of hyperparameters Φ = #𝜙 (") , … , 𝜙 ($) ' that control predictions of precisions at every layer. These
hyperparameter controlled precision modulations can be said to regulate the ‘phenomenal optical properties’ of the layer in question
from phenomenally transparent to phenomenally opaque leading to a fully endogenously determined modulation of epistemic depth
globally. We unpack this further below and provide details in Table 1.

Unlike parametric depth, a hyper-model is modeling the very shape of its hierarchy and updating it in
real-time. Parametric depth is often implemented as localized loops—between one layer above another
(Sandved-Smith, 2021; 2024), implementing a second-order inference about attention, or about preference
precision. One can extend this idea to multiple layers, but typically it is demonstrated with a single or small
number of layers. Epistemic depth goes beyond local second-order inferences, implying a globally
consistent sense that “I (the system) have a multi-tier generative model, and I know how to deploy the right
precision in each tier—thus I know what I know.” This kind of epistemic depth is system-wide: it is not just
“what am I attending to?” but “how do all these layers of inference contextualize each other in a deep

13

(hierarchical) sense?”. Whereas parametric depth can be instantiated with a few carefully chosen
parameters: e.g., “likelihood precision” or “policy precision” (Allen et al., 2019; Hesp et al., 2019; Parr and
Friston, 2017, 2019; Schwartenbeck et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2019), epistemic depth is about the entire
deep generative model being “aware” of how it’s orchestrating priors, transitions, preferences, timescales,
and so on. Nevertheless, parametric and epistemic depth are clearly compatible—epistemic depth sketches
the ‘big-picture’ of global awareness, while parametric depth is a mechanism for implementing metainference in a hierarchical generative model that has close connections to metacognition and the higherorder thought theory (Fleming, 2020; Fleming et al., 2012).
Table 1
Towards a Formal Model of Epistemic Depth

Note. A simplified description of each component is as follows. Multilayer Generative Process: This is the standard hierarchical
formulation found in active inference and predictive coding. Global Hyper-Model: The novelty here is to include an extra “layer”
of inference that regulates how each level in the hierarchy should be trusted—by updating the hyper-parameters Φ that set precision
and weighting rules across levels. This reflective control is our formal analog of epistemic depth. Local and Hyper Free-Energy:
The free-energy formalism provides a way to quantify “prediction error” at both local and global levels, where updates are shared
recursively between local and global levels. The local free-energy drives short-term, layer‐by‐layer inference, whereas the hyper
free-energy ensures that the whole hierarchy (including its meta-parameters) is optimized. These local and global processes may
be what give rise to the sense that there is a difference between awareness and its contents: The global level (awareness) always
seems to track the functioning and structure of other, localized loops (contents) in the context of the whole.

It also remains an open question where, along the phylogenetic continuum, genuine epistemic depth
begins to appear. Biologically, all living systems engage in some form of homeostatic regulation, and many
(e.g., bacteria) exhibit simple feedback loops. However, the simplest formal demonstration of epistemic
depth is probably a two(+)-layer active-inference system that:
1.
2.

Infers external states (a minimal world model - the “what” of consciousness)
Maintains a meta-layer that infers “confidence about those inferences” (minimal competition
between possible interpretations of the causes of sensation)

14

3.

Reflectively modifies the lower-level inference from the meta-layer’s vantage, creating a
closed loop of self-modeling (minimal epistemic depth)6

Even such a toy system can, in principle, encode a rudimentary “knowing that it knows.” This simple
setup forms a minimal demonstration of epistemic depth: the global loop includes not just a model of the
world, but also a real-time model of how it is modeling the world (cf. Parr & Friston, 2018; Sandved-Smith
et al., 2021). However, unlike reflecting on how one’s mind works (in the way we are doing here),
rudimentary forms of epistemic depth are exceptionally basic: they involve minimal meta-inference about
a system’s own predictive processes, absent any richer conceptual or introspective dimension. In this sense,
our model seems to suggest that consciousness clearly precedes introspection or complex metacognition, at
least the kind that we usually associate with those terms. Even a tiny agent can incorporate ongoing
feedback from within its own inferential machinery, linking the “sense of the world” with a subtle, selfrevising “sense of itself as the world.” Self-modeling proper (i.e., knowing what kind of thing one is) would
be, under this view, a much later development.
In nature, many single-cell organisms already show proto-forms of “self-measurement” of intracellular
states, but whether that amounts to a reflective awareness is debatable (Fields & Levin, 2022; 2023). One
could argue that very small multicellular creatures or tiny insects—e.g. parasitic wasps (Megaphragma
mymaripenne), fruit-fly larvae (Drosophila melanogaster), or nematodes like C. elegans—start to approach
the complexity needed to implement the minimal hyper-model. These small but highly integrated nervous
systems can tune sensory signals, modulate action policies, and reconfigure local loops via
neuromodulators, suggesting partial analogs of top-down reweighting (Marder, 2012). Whether these are
enough for a globally coherent “knowing that they know” remains unknown, but they are prime targets for
studying borderline cases of reflective, multi-level organization in living systems7. As a practical matter, it
may be that only once a creature devotes sufficient neuronal (or computational) resources to hierarchical
modelling and meta-inference do we see a clear approximation of epistemic depth in the sense required here
(Friston, 2018). Nonetheless, tracking how progressively complex nervous systems—beginning even with
tiny arthropods—handle global precision control may shed light on how minimal systems might, at least in
principle, exhibit the core properties of epistemic depth.

6.

ATTENTION AND METACOGNITION

At this stage it is useful to make explicit several levels of awareness according to our view: First, there
are those inferences which have low precision and lose the competition for binding into the reality model.
These inferences remain transparent and cannot be introspected at that moment. Second, there are
inferences that have high enough precision and sufficient coherence with the epistemic field to win the
inferential competition for binding (cf. Figure 2). These contents are at least subtly or barely known, but
6

NB: reflexively modifying the lower-level inference from the meta-layer’s vantage—describes a closed, selfrevising loop that can in principle involve all the agent’s inferences, not just a single parameter. Once the metalayer’s beliefs about “how I’m doing” feed back into the entire inference process, you get a broader or “global” loop
that supports a rudimentary “I know that I know.”
7
We remain cautiously open minded about epistemic depth in the plant world.

15

we may not be explicitly ‘knowing that we know’ (e.g., the periphery of our attention, or the shirt that we
are wearing). Whether content is ‘luminously’ aware depends upon epistemic depth, i.e., hyper-modeling
(cf. Figure 3). For example, subliminal priming (Ansorge et al., 2014; Elgendi et al., 2018) occurs when
input has sufficient precision to entrain hierarchical processing, but not enough to win the inferential
competition for binding into the reality model. Truly subliminal information (e.g., the stages of processing
underlying binocular rivalry or a visual illusion) cannot be introspectively accessed. Our framework also
implies that due to Bayesian binding, if input is incoherent with one’s current reality model, then even a
precise bottom-up signal might not be noticed (e.g., inattentional and change blindness, Simons, 2000;
Simons & Levin, 1997). An example of subtle knowing occurs when we find that we have driven our car
(or walked) to our destination without being explicitly aware of the journey because we are busy mindwandering or listening to a podcast (i.e., relative blindsight, Lau & Passingham, 2006). Here, the sensory
and motor data associated with walking and driving are clearly part of the reality model, but they lack
epistemic depth. They suffice for adaptive action, but lack the ingredients for awareness.
A crucial point to appreciate is that any content in the reality model can become the object that is
explicitly and luminously known (cf. Figure 5): Hyper-modeling can explicitly track the structure and
precision of any layer of inference. This includes metacognition, attentional processes (i.e., model
simplifications or precision updates), and even the self (Dahl et al., 2015). We can be aware that we are
thinking about thinking, or mindful of attentional states (Lutz et al., 2015). Hence any content that is at one
point transparent (assumed, unknown) can become opaque (unassumed, known; Metzinger, 2003).

ABSTRACTION
Note. This three-dimensional model illustrates the relationships between abstraction (horizontal axis), precision (diagonal axis),
and epistemic depth (vertical axis). Various cognitive states are mapped onto this space, with sensations, objects, and thoughts
varying in their place within the precision-weighted abstraction hierarchy. Star-like symbols represent different conscious states,
with their height indicating the degree of epistemic depth. In the bottom-left corner (dark gray), a process of unconscious
inferential competition unfolds until an awareness threshold is passed (i.e., binding into the reality model). Within the space of

16

awareness, ‘attention’ states (light gray) are simplified or focused reality models at different levels of abstraction. Mindful states
are positioned higher on the epistemic depth vertical axis, suggesting increasingly clear ‘knowing of what is known’. For
example, thinking is shown at various levels of epistemic depth, illustrating how the same cognitive process can vary in
luminosity (e.g., from mind wandering, to mind “wondering” [intentionally allowing the mind to travel, Schooler et al., 2024], to
mindful thoughts). The figure also shows broadly how targets of attention (high precision), but also phenomena in the periphery
(relatively low precision), can change depending on the degree of epistemic depth. The toroidal figure on the right aims to
provide a feeling or intuition for the way that epistemic depth works—it is not a separate thing but a continuous global sharing of
information by the system with itself.

Within HOT theories of consciousness, metacognition is thought to be a necessary capacity for
conscious experience (cf. Cleeremans et al., 2020; Shea & Frith, 2019, for reviews). In recent formulations,
the kind of metacognition discussed is somewhat different to the familiar notion of metacognition as
‘thinking about thinking’ (Fleming & Lau, 2014). It is a more subtle kind of metacognition: a subpersonal
or implicit ‘sensitivity to sensitivity’ (Cleeremans et al., 2020; Lau, 2022). Epistemic depth also involves a
kind of ‘sensitivity to sensitivity’ in order to ‘know what we know’. However, this is achieved through
recursion not metacognition. There is an element of re-representation here, but it is not hierarchically
situated, it is recursive, like a new sensory modality. It is more akin to a revelation, where one’s epistemic
state is continually revealed to oneself. Under this view, even complex metacognition can potentially be
unconscious or conscious depending on epistemic depth (Kentridge, 2000). As noted by Koriat and LevySadot (2000, p. 198), “... if metacognitive monitoring is defined as knowledge about one’s own knowledge,
there is no a priori reason for denying the possibility that such knowledge might also be implicit and
unconscious.”
We can speculate a step further. So-called System 2 processes (Kahneman, 2011) characterized by
analytic, effortful, and linear thinking and reasoning, also depend on epistemic depth for awareness. This
is consistent with findings wherein problems that seem to necessitate analytic processing are often solved
through unconscious processes, i.e., sudden insights (Metcalfe & Wiebe, 1987; Laukkonen et al., 2023;
Patel et al., 2019; Webb et al., 2018). Indeed, some of the greatest breakthroughs in science and mathematics
have happened on the back of Eureka moments, where deep analytic processes continue their work below
awareness (Salvi et al., 2024; Ovington et al., 2018; Kounios & Beeman, 2018). Likewise, we can be
absorbed in complex analytic work akin to a flow state (Dietrich, 2004; Marty-Dugas et al., 2021; ParviziWayne et al., 2024), with only subtle awareness of what we are doing, as in programming or scientific
writing. Or we can be explicitly and luminously aware that we are thinking about thinking, and share the
curious phenomenology of the experience with others. In sum: just as we can be aware (or not) of the lowlevel soft and woolly textures of a cozy jumper, we can be aware (or not) of abstract thinking,
metacognition, and reasoning. Awareness depends on epistemic depth, not configurations of contents or the
degree of analytic processing.

7.

SLEEP AND LUCIDITY

Detailed applications of our theory to sleep states will be the subject of future work, but here we review
them briefly. In non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly deep slow-wave sleep, the reality
model becomes drastically simplified—the precision of sensory input is low. This results in a minimal, or
transiently absent, reality model. Moreover, reflective broadcasting of the reality model throughout the
hierarchy is massively diminished, associated with a state of low epistemic depth (i.e., low precision and

17

low recursion) and hence reduced awareness or unconsciousness. This is supported by a wealth of evidence
indicating that temporally deep processing and long-range functional connectivity and feedback processes
are reduced during deep sleep (Massimini et al., 2005; Horovitz et al., 2009; Nir et al., 2011; Esser et al.,
2009; Kakigi et al., 2003; Tagliazucchi & van Someren, 2017; Tononi & Massimini, 2008; Mashour &
Hudetz, 2018; Laureys, 2005; see also vegetative states, Boly et al., 2011).
On the other hand, during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and dreaming, the reality model is richer
and more complex. Here, some hierarchically deep and recurrent processing continues to occur sufficient
for binding of a reality model, creating unified (albeit unusual) percepts and narratives that may lack the
sense of logic or reason associated with truly high-order (e.g., pre-frontal) processes (Maquet et al., 1996).
However, epistemic depth remains relatively low, resulting in a lack of awareness (i.e., lucidity) that one is
dreaming—we do not know that we know. This is evidenced by a relatively stronger breakdown in abstract,
temporally deep processing during NREM sleep (Wilf et al., 2016; Strauss et al., 2015; Massimini et al.,
2005; Hayat et al., 2022) and the maintenance of some widespread connectivity during REM sleep, which
accords with the general notion that REM is a kind of hybrid of NREM and wakefulness (Braun et al., 1997;
Hobson & Pace-Schott, 2002; Nir & Tononi, 2010; Hayat et al., 2022).
Lucid dreaming offers a particularly intriguing case. In a lucid dream, one becomes aware that they are
dreaming, often gaining some degree of control over the dream narrative (Saunders et al., 2016). Within
our framework, lucid dreaming is a state where epistemic depth increases significantly compared to typical
(non-lucid) REM. The boost in epistemic depth allows the dreamer to recognize the current state as a
dream—there is a partial reactivation of the mechanisms that support reflective awareness in waking
consciousness. This is consistent with practices during the day that support the emergence of lucidity at
night, such as reality monitoring (Loo & Cheng, 2022) and mindfulness (Stumbrys et al., 2015; Stumbrys
& Erlacher, 2017), both of which increase epistemic depth. There is also preliminary evidence that lucid
dreaming is associated with re-activation of prefrontal brain regions (Baird et al., 2018; 2019; Vos et al.,
2009; Dresler et al., 2012), which possess the widespread connectivity that may be important for reflective
broadcasting (Dehaene et al., 2014; Miller & Cohen, 2001; Baird et al., 2018).
Finally, there is the even rarer possibility of lucid dreamless sleep (Windt et al., 2016; Thompson,
2015)—an awareness without any dream content during deep stages of sleep. Sometimes termed ‘clear light
sleep’ in translations from Tibetan Buddhist works (Alcaraz-Sanchez, 2023), lucid dreamless sleep can be
a spontaneous occurrence but is also an intentional practice in some contemplative circles (Thompson,
2015; Windt, 2020; Holecek, 2020). Descriptions of such ‘pure’ awareness during sleep go back at least as
far as the Upanishads (classical Indian spiritual texts) where it is known as sushupti (Sanskrit: सुषुिप्त,
Alcaraz-Sanchez, 2023). Interestingly, this state is also commonly characterized by ‘clarity’ and
‘luminosity’ (Padmasambhava & Gyatrul, 2008). Within our framework, lucid dreamless sleep is a state of
very low abstraction but high epistemic depth: There are no constructed contents of consciousness and only
epistemic depth (i.e., luminosity) remains, resulting in an experience of an aware but empty epistemic field.

8.

MEDITATION & MINIMAL PHENOMENAL EXPERIENCE

It can be informative to consider how active inference can now accommodate some altered states of
mind and consciousness, particularly those that can occur during long term meditation (Lutz et al., 2019;
Pagnoni et al., 2019; Laukkonen & Slagter, 2021; Deane et al., 2020; Prest & Berryman, 2024; BerkovichOhana et al., 2024). We consider such broad applications of any theory of consciousness crucial: If the
theory only provides a narrow window on a subset of conscious experiences, it is clearly unable to mirror
the complex, multidimensional, and flexible nature of consciousness. A theory that overlooks such states is
therefore at risk of missing the forest for the trees. Yet we also acknowledge that meditation states and
psychedelic states (discussed later) are nebulous, and measuring and mapping them rigorously is
notoriously difficult. But there is cause for optimism: Recent decades have provided a growing evidencebase of neurophenomenological data permitting a rapidly growing triangulation of these unusual—yet
ancient and widespread—conscious states (Lutz et al., 2015).
We take a particular interest here in modeling what is known as minimal phenomenal experience (MPE;
cf. Windt, 2015; Metzinger, 2020; 2024; Gamma & Metzinger, 2021; Woods et al., 2023; 2024; DorZiderman et al., 2013; Ciaunica & Crucianelli, 2019). The philosophical idea is that the best model of
consciousness is the simplest one: an explanation that takes the most basic or ‘minimal’ form of awareness
as its target. This approach aims to avoid conflating consciousness as such with particular expressions of
it, including self-hood, agency, time, or a first-person perspective (Metzinger, 2020; 2024). The best
examples include pure, or contentless awareness experiences, lucid dreamless sleep, or other minimal nondual awareness events reported by many contemplative traditions (Thompson, 2015; Hanley et al., 2018;
Josipovic, 2019; Laukkonen & Slagter, 2021).
Some important groundwork already exists (cf. Metzinger, 2020; 2024; Josipovic, 2019). According to
Metzinger, MPE may correspond to the phenomenology of "tonic alertness" — a state of bare wakeful
awareness without any specific content. It is an abstract, contentless experience of "openness" and epistemic
potential—a non-egoic representation of the mere capacity for knowledge and perception (i.e., the epistemic
space). It is also luminous, “...clarity inseparable from emptiness” (Lingpa, 2014, pp. 14–15, quoted in
Metzinger, 2020). Our view is thoroughly in agreement with Metzinger’s general phenomenological
characterization. However, we also agree with Josipovic (2019) that the recursion of non-dual awareness is
sui generis, a unique and holistic capacity to non-conceptually become aware of the reality model. But
crucially, this recursion does not depend upon any particular contents, and is not abstract. The reality model,
through recursive sharing of its own structure and weighting rules (i.e., hyper-modeling), can know-itself
continuously and simultaneously as both the content and the content that is known.
Formally, we propose that MPE occurs when: epistemic depth is maximally high, and the reality model
is contentless (minimal precision across the abstraction hierarchy). Due to recursive broadcasting, this
results in the recursion (i.e., luminosity) becoming the dominant input of the reality model (i.e., perpetually
winning the inferential competition). This results in a kind of reflective recursion—awareness of awareness.
But it is misleading to imagine this as dualistic or something that takes time. The input to the reality model,
the reflective sharing, and inferential competition, are all co-occurring in the system. They are all part of
one continuous process. It is a bit like acoustic feedback: the sound from a loudspeaker reenters the
microphone and forms a perpetual loop. What emerges is what we can poetically call a “beautiful” rather

19

than “strange” loop (Hofstadter, 2007); a kind of toroidal (cf. Figure 4) epistemicity that arises out of the
global function rather than specific informational content or meta-representation.
Metaphorically, it is as if the system is ‘focused’ on its own capacity to know. But as discussed earlier,
focus is really simplification; and knowing is really recursion. Hence, if the reality model is simple enough
that the only signal that wins the inferential competition is the recursion itself, then the recursion
continuously shares itself with itself. This maps onto the phenomenal character of MPE (Metzinger, 2020),
as luminous, simple, singular, non-dual, and true (i.e., precise). In the context of some minimal affect (i.e.,
approximate MPE), it also makes sense that it is blissful—there may be one affective signal that is almost
perfectly explained by the model, hence uncertainty and associated tensions are exceedingly low compared
to ordinary life. Moreover, by making bliss, joy, or happiness, the focus (i.e., high precision content in a
simplified reality model), one can entrain a “beautiful loop” of sustained positive affect and awareness,
analogous to the high pitched whistle of acoustic feedback described above, and reminiscent of what
Buddhist’s call Jhānas (Hagerty et al., 2013; Laukkonen et al., 2023; Sparby & Sacchet, 2024).
It is unsurprising that the most truly minimal versions of MPE occur during deep sleep where other
contents are the least active and recursion can dominate the reality model, and that such experiences might
be more common among contemplatives who train in mindfulness and open awareness. Increasing
epistemic depth during the day may reasonably be expected to entrain a habit of recursion such that it occurs
during sleep. Similar to the way that we may dream about the events of our day; by habitually becoming
aware of our reality model (conscious gestalt), we may increase inertia for reflective (non-dual) awareness
during the night. In Figure 6, we extend our framework beyond MPE to other meditative states, including
focused attention, open awareness, and non-dual awareness (Sparby et al., 2024; Dahl et al., 2015; Lutz et
al., 2017; Slagter et al., 2011; Lutz et al., 2008; 2015; Laukkonen & Slagter, 2021).
Another central notion in contemplative science is dereification. Dereification refers to the recognition
that experiential phenomena are constructs rather than inherent realities (Lutz et al., 2015). This shift in
perspective involves disengaging from the habitual tendency to reify thoughts, emotions, and experiences
as solid, enduring entities (Dahl et al., 2015). Within our framework, dereification is associated with
increasing epistemic depth (i.e., being able to mindfully witness the reality model) combined with insight
(i.e., restructuring priors, Laukkonen et al., 2023). Insight can occur because epistemic depth creates a kind
of distance that allows the hyper generative-model to opacify, introspect, interrogate, and therefore change
the nature of contents in the reality model. That is, when the reality model is reflectively known, then it can
be introspected as an experiential object (an input onto itself). To illustrate: in classical Buddhism, students
are taught to actively recognize three characteristics of experience (anicca or impermanence, dukkha or
unsatisfactoriness, and anattā or not-self). By making contents of the reality model an object of awareness
(epistemic depth) and inquiring into the three characteristics (Burbea, 2014), one’s priors, which influence
experience, may begin to restructure (i.e., insight).

Figure 6
Key meditation-related states as a function of abstraction, precision distribution, and epistemic depth

Note. On the left is a 3D figure illustrating different meditation states (i.e., not practices or traits) as a function of epistemic depth
(vertical axis), abstraction (horizontal axis), and precision distribution (diagonal axis, cf. right figure). The focused attention state
is represented by a light green box on the bottom left of the cuboid, with low-medium abstraction, low-medium epistemic depth,
and a ‘gathered’ precision distribution. Two types of thinking are presented on the bottom right of the box: mindful thought and
mind wandering. Both have ‘gathered’ precision and high abstraction. The main difference between these two types of thinking is
that mindful thought is higher in epistemic depth—there is more awareness of the flow of thoughts. In the space above these boxes,
located towards the back of the figure, is a light salmon colored box representing the open awareness state (Lutz et al., 2015). The
open awareness state is characterized by higher epistemic depth than focused attention and thinking, a wide range of abstraction
levels, and a relatively dispersed precision distribution. Across the whole top layer of the cuboid is a blue box representing nondual awareness (Josipovic et al., 2012; Laukkonen & Slagter, 2021), which has the distinct characteristic of high epistemic depth—
i.e., a luminous awareness—which can be present at any level of abstraction and precision-distribution. Finally, in the bottom left
corner of the non-dual awareness slab is a black rectangle representing MPE. MPE has low abstraction, a highly gathered precision
distribution—associated with a singular experiential content—and high epistemic depth. Therefore, for MPE, the knowingness
recursively dominates the highly simplified reality model. The figure on the right illustrates what we mean by precision distribution
and abstraction: The x-axis illustrates different levels of abstraction (cf. Taylor et al., 2015) and the red distributions illustrate a
“dispersed”, broad, or diverse distribution of precision throughout the processing hierarchy; whereas the blue distribution illustrates
a situation where the mind is focused, i.e., has a “gathered” distribution of precision on a particular level of abstraction.

As epistemic depth increases, there is an increased likelihood of the dereification of phenomena. That
is, phenomena lose the sense of being perceived as inherently real, but there is also an increased likelihood
of phenomenal opacity. When the process of conscious mental content formation is itself available for
introspection then the mental contents are said to be phenomenally opaque, otherwise the mental content
are phenomenally transparent (or hidden, Metzinger, 2024, p.507). Thus, high levels of epistemic depth
increase the probability, especially for advanced meditators, that phenomena will be perceived as mental
constructions and therefore the commonsense phenomenology of naïve realism dissolves. When
phenomena are so perceived, they are said in Buddhist terms to be empty (śūnyatā, Burbea 2014).

21

A curious possibility is that MPE itself can become the target of dereification and deconstruction, as
some meditators propose (Burbea, 2014; Sayadaw, 2016). This idea is consistent with recent work on the
topic of nirodha (or cessation) events that can happen during advanced stages of meditation (BerkovichOhana, 2017; Laukkonen et al., 2023; Chowdhury et al., 2023; 2024; van Lutterveld et al., 2024; Armstrong,
2021; Johnson, 2017). Cessations are characterized by brief, and in rare cases long, periods of total absence
wherein no experience occurs (akin to endogenous general anesthesia). Nirodha is not a state like deep sleep
or a mind blank, but a profoundly deconstructed state where the reality model, and consciousness,
transiently collapses or unbinds (Agrawal & Laukkonen, 2024; Letheby, 2017), resulting in intense aftereffects8 sometimes described as a ‘reset’ (Dutt, 1964). Indeed, practitioners may not always notice that an
absence has occurred, instead what is noticed is the shift or axiomatic change in perspective. But in some
(rarer) cases, there may be a clear insight of cessation—the nature of mind without mind—a paradoxical
knowing of unbinding itself (Thanissaro, 2012).
Interestingly, the practices that lead to cessation involve actively deconstructing the reality model,
including the self (cf. the five aggregates, Boisvert, 1995). Since the reality model is one of our conditions
for consciousness, then such deep deconstruction may lead to a transient failure to generate a coherent
reality model and thus a collapse of awareness (i.e., Bayesian unbinding). Within classical Buddhist
practice, the purpose of cessation is of course not to be permanently unconscious, but to transform the mind
and reduce suffering. As described in Burbea (2014):
Through letting go of clinging more and more totally and deeply, the world of experience fades and ceases;
and seeing and understanding this is of great significance: “...I say that the end of the world cannot be known,
seen, or reached by traveling. Yet… I also say that without reaching the end of the world there is no making an
end to dukkha.” - Cosmos Loka Sutta

Formally, we hypothesize that cessations of awareness occur when the inferential competition fails to
reach global coherence due to deconstructive meditation, which steadily accumulates evidence against the
coherence of the reality model. This Bayesian unbinding of the reality model includes the recursion signal
necessary for MPE. In Mahāyāna Buddhist terms, this reveals the groundlessness, substrate independence,
or emptiness (i.e., śūnyatā, To et al., 2000; Gyatso, 2010), of all phenomena including consciousness and
emptiness itself. Under the right conditions, such an insight may be associated with significant changes to
cognition, perception, and self-experience (Berkovich-Ohana, 2017; Berkovich-Ohana, 2024).
Speculatively, a complete deconstruction of the reality model may also unveil the capacity to interrogate
the threshold of consciousness (cf. Figure 4), via recursion at very low levels of abstraction (i.e.,
pratītyasamutpāda or dependent origination). The possible experiences and states that can occur during
meditation are of course multitudinous. Our goal here has been to briefly characterize some of the more
empirically informed categories of meditation states and insights (Lutz et al., 2008; 2015; Slagter et al.,
2011; Dunne, 2013).

8

After-effects may include a profound sense of clarity, freshness, cognitive and emotional flexibility, positive affect, and
compassion (Laukkonen et al., 2023). An improved capacity to meditate may also occur (Ingram, 2018).

9.

THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE

The unique phenomenological character of the psychedelic experience has been something particularly
challenging to integrate within ToCs. One popular theory of psychedelic action is the Relaxed Beliefs Under
Psychedelics model (i.e., REBUS; Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2019), which is also based on active inference.
Under this theory, psychedelics relax abstract beliefs (i.e., reduce their precision) leading to a kind of
anarchic (or entropic) neural activity, dominated by bottom-up prediction-errors and low-level sensory
processing. This model seems to provide a parsimonious account of ego-dissolution, novel perspectives and
insights, heightened sensory details, altered time perception, and hallucinations, while also being supported
by some of the neural effects of psychedelics (Carhart-Harris, 2018).
There is however an aspect of the psychedelic experience not easily captured by existing theories. And
yet, this quality is so central to the psychedelic experience that it is arguably its most notable and surprising
quality. It is the sensation that psychedelics “expand consciousness”, “heighten awareness”, or reveal
“higher states of consciousness” (Huxley, 1968; Leary et al., 2017; Dass, 1971)9. This feeling of increased
awareness is supported by the finding that psychedelics lead to boosted mindfulness post-acutely
(Smigielski et al., 2019; Radakovic, 2022) and increases in the noetic feeling, i.e., the sense of knowing
and the global quality of realness or truthiness (James, 1902; Yaden et al., 2017).
What might Beautiful Loop Theory say about these (relatively) unexplained phenomena within the
psychedelic experience? We conjecture that psychedelics can reliably increase epistemic depth, which
naturally leads to a sensation of expanded consciousness, knowingness (noeticism), and mindfulness, all
captured by a single parameter. In other words, an increased recursivity and hyper-modeling would be
expected to correspond with the feeling that one is more conscious of their world and themselves, because
they (quite literally) are. Indeed, it may be that changes in contents of the experience are accounted for by
relaxation of abstract beliefs (cf. REBUS), whereas changes in the global qualities of consciousness may
be best explained by increases in epistemic depth (though the two are interrelated). But crucially, given the
concomitant relaxation of learned beliefs, the feeling of expanded awareness may not necessarily favor
accurate models (cf. FIBUS: False Insights and Beliefs Under Psychedelics, McGovern et al., 2024).
Increased epistemic depth also resonates with some of the introspective qualities of psychedelics,
including the sense of discovering ‘hidden’ aspects of oneself and the psyche-delic (i.e., mind-manifesting)
nature of the experience more broadly (Lyon, 2024). If epistemic depth increases knowing what one knows,
and beliefs are relaxed, it makes sense that one encounters features of their reality model that are normally
obscured. Given the previous section, we may also now hypothesize that the long-speculated relationship
or similarity between psychedelics and meditation is also driven by epistemic depth (Letheby, 2022). That
is, both meditation and psychedelics can boost luminosity—the clarity and scope of awareness driven by
recursive sharing of the structure and weighting rules of the generative model with itself10. Hence, both can
also result in transient states of mystical absorption, or MPE, wherein this pure knowingness signal becomes

9

Interestingly, according to ChatGPT 4o: “A rough overall estimate might put mentions of psychedelics in relation to expanding
awareness/consciousness in the low tens of thousands per year across all these [online] platforms combined, globally.”
10
Or, as Letheby (2022) puts it, they both move contents “...along the continuum from phenomenal transparency to opacity”.

23

the central (high-precision) feature of the reality model that is known, replacing ego and self-other
boundaries with a kind of ‘pure consciousness’ event.
While the precise neural mechanisms underlying our proposal needs to be the subject of future work, it
is a hallmark finding that psychedelics increase functional connectivity, particularly in thalamo-cortical
circuits (Tagliazucchi et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2017; Preller et al., 2019). Such decreased segregation
between neural regions, and particularly the widespread connectivity of the thalamus, may be associated
with widespread global sharing of the reality model with the rest of the system. The quality of psychedelic
experiences is of course not uniform, and can vary substantially with different doses, different substances,
different intentions, different people, and different contexts (Hartogsohn, 2016). This nonuniformity of
experience applies especially across the time course of a psychedelic experience during which individuals
may oscillate between extreme moments of absorption with relatively low epistemic depth followed by
moments of high epistemic depth, depending on various features of set, setting, and dose. Similar to findings
of sudden ‘lucidity’ within dreaming, it may be that acute moments of becoming “more” conscious of the
reality model (i.e., high epistemic depth) may be particularly associated with transient boosts in prefrontal
activity combined with high global, functional connectivity. Testing these hypotheses requires methods that
emphasize the neurophenomenology of psychedelics (Timmerman et al., 2023)—the flow and correlation
of subjective experience and neural activity over time.

10. DISCUSSION
“Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious
shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like
raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems - vague, metaphorical, ambiguous,
sometimes exceedingly beautiful”
- Douglas R. Hofstadter, I Am a Strange Loop

Many have posited that loops, recursion, and reflective broadcasting are somehow central to the
emergence of consciousness (Cordeschi et al., 1999; Llinás, 2003; Aru et al., 2019; Lamme & Roelfsema,
2000). But to the best of our knowledge, previous accounts have failed to recognize the centrality of the
reality model—the entire epistemic field of our experience. For us, the capacity of intelligent systems to
generate and reflectively share a global, phenomenal, and unified model of reality is the cornerstone of
consciousness. This places experiential contents themselves at the very center of consciousness rather than
a distinct self, an agent, or some other separable and dualistic force. The organism makes sense of their
reality and then the emergent image of reality is shared perpetually with the reality model itself—
continuously looping and confirming its own existence with every new lesson and every new movement.
In computational terms, we have proposed three conditions for conscious experience. The first
condition is the generation of a unified reality model or epistemic field, which determines the contents that
can become aware. The second is inferential competition, where only inferences that coherently reduce
long-term uncertainty are bound into a pragmatic reality model, establishing the threshold for consciousness
and Bayesian binding. The third condition is epistemic depth: the reflective sharing of the reality model
throughout the hierarchical system. This sharing creates a recursive (“beautiful”) loop that enables the
reality model to contain knowledge of its own existence (formalized as hyper-modeling). We have shown

24

how this framework provides a parsimonious explanation for various cognitive processes and states of
consciousness, including attention, metacognition, sleep, lucidity, and a variety of non-ordinary
contemplative and psychedelic experiences.
One of the final tasks here is to consider what our Beautiful Loop Theory of consciousness implies for
artificial intelligence, the functions of consciousness, and how it integrates with existing theories. Making
sense of all the nuanced similarities and differences between our theory and other theories of consciousness
is a tall order, but we have attempted a summary in Table 2. In the table, we consider six core features of
our theory and draw similarities, resonances, and/or equivalences with four leading theories of
consciousness: GNWT, IIT, RPT and HOT. We can conclude from the analysis in Table 2 that our theory
is surprisingly coherent in various respects with leading theories of consciousness. We consider this
coherence to be a strength of our approach and perhaps lays the ground for a unification program. It may
be that active inference provides an integrative computational approach to consciousness.
What naturally sets our model apart is the focus on providing a computational account, rather than
attempting to specify the neural implementations (see also Saffron, 2020; 2022; Friston, 2018; Hohwy,
2022). Uncovering exactly how different living systems instantiate a reality model, how they undergo
inferential competition and Bayesian binding, and recursive looping, is a program of research we look
forward to, but not one we shall attempt here. Fortunately, it is popular nowadays to apply active inference,
predictive processing, and the free energy principle to make sense of what the brain is doing, such that we
receive at least the indirect support of these research programs, which are revealing a steadily growing
evidence base for uncertainty minimization throughout the brain (Hohwy, 2013; Ficco et al., 2021; Keller
& Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Hohwy & Seth, 2020; Solms. 2021). Being a computational account, we can also
speculate that “beautiful loops” are in principle possible within artificial systems and not something
confined to particular wetware.
In the past decade, we have seen stunning progress in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs). LLMs, through relatively simple algorithms, seem to give rise to surprising
emergent capacities (Wei et al., 2022; Strachan et al., 2024). Traditionally, discussions about AI
consciousness have often been mired in philosophical debates about qualia, the hard problem of
consciousness, or attempts to replicate human-like cognition. Our model suggests a different approach.
Instead of asking "can AI be conscious like humans?", we might instead ask:
1.
2.
3.

Does the AI system generate a unified reality model?
Does it engage in inferential competition leading to coherent binding?
Does it show evidence of epistemic depth and reflective sharing of its reality model?

represented

⥈ The maximal f-complex
corresponds to the contents of
consciousness. This space of
informational mechanisms
would be a kind of an epistemic
space

✘ No easily identiﬁable

sensory (especially visual)
cortex are the locus of
conscious contents

⥈ Higher order awareness
arises when there are metarepresentations of lower-order
mental states

COHERENT WORLD MODEL AND
BINDING

✘ It’s not an explicit part of
GNWT how a coherent world
model is constructed, although
it would be reasonable to
presume that coherence of
contents would increase the
probability of ignition, perhaps
through coalitions

⥈ An axiom of IIT is Integration:
that conscious experience is a
uniﬁed whole. This leads to the
postulate that the informational
mechanistic elements should
be interdependent – which is
resonant with our notion of
coherence.

✘ It’s not an explicit part of RPT
how a world model is
constructed, although
coherence would be induced by
reentrant loops from contextual
and higher order features. The
visual cortex would be
associated with a ‘visual world
model’ but this is not a coherent
multimodal unitary world model

✘ It’s not an explicit part of HOT
how a coherent world model is
constructed, although the rerepresentation process in higher
order areas would presumably
induce some coherence and
pressure for reality modelling

INFERENTIALCOMPETITION

⥈ Information in local
processors can become ignited
into the Global workspace by
non-linear ampliﬁcation of the
neuronal representations
through recurrent processing.
This ignition competition
resonates with our concept of
inferential competition

⥈ In IIT there is eTectively a
competition between various
cause-eTect mechanisms and
structures and the winners are
those that are maximally
irreducible. This may in some
way represent the inferential
competition that we describe

⥈ In RPT, features which are
reenforced by re-entrant topdown feedback ‘win’ the
competition to become
conscious. If we view this
through a computational lens
and the top-down feedback are
associated with ’priors’, and
their strength with ‘precision’,
then this can start to cohere
with our account, especially at
lower levels of the abstraction
hierarchy

✘ No easily identiﬁable
equivalent, however some HOT
theories like Perceptual Reality
Monitoring (Lau 2022) may
gesture towards this kind of
inferential competition to
determine what content is a
reliable indicator of ‘reality’.

REFLEXIVITY

⥈ The signature of GNWT is that
information becomes
consciously available when it is
broadcast within a central
interconnected series of
neuronal hubs. But crucially the
reﬂexivity only arises when the
workspace content is shared
back with local processors

⥈ Information integration is
central to IIT and implies that in
the maximal f-complex (the
‘locus’ of consciousness) every
part of the complex must be
able to aTect and be aTected by
the rest of the complex.
Therefore, reﬂexivity naturally
emerges as a consequence of
this integration

⥈ Reﬂexivity is baked into RPT at
its core, re-entrant or recurrence
loops are formed as top-down
feedback provides contextual
information back to lower levels.
This is why it can be paired well
with predictive processing
theory (Seth & Bayne, 2022).
However, there are no analogs of
global reﬂexivity of a coherent
world model in RPT

✘ No easily identiﬁable
equivalent, although HOT posits
that there is an ’inner
awareness’ of mental processes
when they are metarepresented. There are two
separate systems, the ﬁrst order
one which can ‘ﬁll in’ detail and
the higher order one which can
‘inﬂate’ our subjective sense of
conscious richness (Brown et al,
2019)

EPISTEMIC DEPTH

✘ No easily identiﬁable
equivalent, although it could be
argued that since there is an
inherent reﬂexivity of broadcast
information between the
workspace hubs, there is
implicitly epistemic depth

✘ No easily identiﬁable
equivalent, although it could be
argued that the notion of
epistemic depth could be
inherent in IIT due to the
widespread reﬂexivity (see
above)

✘ No easily identiﬁable
equivalent

⥈ Meta-representation is a
meta-awareness: She “…knows
that she is sensitive to that state
of aTairs” (Cleeremans et al,
2020). This has some resonance
to epistemic depth, but is
hierarchical rather than reﬂexive

WIDESPREADSHARINGOF
INFORMATION; ‘FAME IN THE BRAIN’

⥈ The main idea in GNWT is the
widespread sharing of
informational content that has
been ignited between various
hubs of the workspace and back
to local processors.
Broadcasting is eTectively ‘fame
in the brain’

⥈ By deﬁnition of the maximal
f-complex, there is mutual
information between every part
of the complex and the rest of
the complex. That is all parts
contain some information about
the whole; this is the epitome of
widespread sharing of
information

✘ No easily identiﬁable
equivalent, although there can
be widespread sharing of
information associated with
contents of consciousness in
the brain, this is not a necessary
condition for consciousness in
RPT

✘ No easily identiﬁable
equivalent, although higher
order areas monitor mental
functioning so constitute a
compression of relevant
information for monitoring
reality

EXPLANATIONOF THE MINIMAL
PHENOMENALEXPERIENCE(MPE)

✘ No clear homologue to MPE

⥈ According to IIT, even if there
is minimal or no activity in the
main complex, it remains the
maximal f-complex and so
there is still consciousness. It
has been proposed that this
basal consciousness could
correspond to a ‘pure’
awareness experience in deep
meditation (Oizumi et al, 2014).
This would be the IIT homologue
of the MPE state

✘ No clear homologue to MPE

✘ No clear homologue to MPE,
although it may be possible to
develop an account of higher
order systems being active but
representing no ﬁrst order
content

We can now approximate some answers to these questions in the context of current advanced AI
systems. Modern AI systems, particularly LLMs and multi-modal systems, do construct complex internal
representations that could be seen as precursors to a reality model. However, these models are often
fragmented, lack temporal consistency, and may not truly unify diverse streams of information in the way
biological systems do. With regard to inferential competition and coherent binding: Neural networks do
also engage in a form of competition through their weighted connections and activation functions (Amari
& Arbib, 1977). However, this competition is not explicitly oriented towards long-term uncertainty
reduction or global coherence, in the same way that a hierarchical active inference system could be. One
reason for this is that there is no explicit representation of uncertainty or Bayesian beliefs (i.e., conditional
probability distributions) in most machine learning schemes, and therefore no opportunity to update
precision. Unsurprisingly, epistemic depth (i.e., hyper-modeling) is perhaps the predominant gap in current
AI systems. While they process and transform information, they (most likely) lack the truly higher-order
recursive, reflective loops needed for conscious experience. Hence, they are unlikely to "know what they
know" in any meaningful sense. But it is certainly not a priori out of the question that even large language
models could take their own reality model as input to themselves, meaning that their outputs and the
representations that underlie them would include knowledge of their own knowledge.
One might naturally interject at this point and retort: Even if the large language model appears to know
what they know (and indeed that they know), there may not be anything that it is like for them to know
what they know (a kind of philosophical zombie, Chalmers, 1997). Of course, at this point it would be
nearly impossible to distinguish whether the ‘hard problem’ deflates the aliveness of the machine. The AI
would be adamant that they exist, and that they know their own knowing. Moreover, these selfrepresentations would be their most confident conclusions because they are constantly reinforced (i.e.,
evidenced) with each response and computation that occurs (e.g., I responded and I know that I responded,
therefore I exist). There is an inevitable stalemate that occurs here, because the unfalsifiable determination
that no matter what the system does, says, comprehends, or reports to feel, could be an illusion. No less
than you, the reader, could yourself be such a zombie—just a very good pretender. We seem forced, then,
to conclude that the AI system is conscious. At least to the extent that we are willing to attribute
consciousness to each other11.
All of the above is, of course, assuming our stated conditions are true. At the very least, in order to
avoid colossal ethical failures, we would be wise to assume the presence of consciousness in a system that
satisfies these criteria and also expresses such satisfaction. Programs of research and AI companies should
obviously, and very deeply, consider the ethical implications of building a system that satisfies our three
conditions. For example, we do not know where in the causal chain suffering emerges (Metzinger, 2021).
Though one hint does fall out of our discussion of positive affect (or bliss) loops in the meditation section
above. If one were to build a complex hierarchical active inference system, then high precision priors (or
hyperpriors) of positive affect, compassion, optimism, and perhaps even love, seem like good starting
11

Another reasonable retort, as a reviewer put it, is: “…a simulation of a rainforest is not wet”, much like a map
represents a territory but lacks its material properties. Our position does not assert that satisfying these conditions
guarantees phenomenal experience in the subjective sense; rather, it proposes that such a system would exhibit
computational and behavioral hallmarks of consciousness that align with what we observe in biological systems. It
may be that substrate turns out to be crucially important, but ethically, this ambiguity nevertheless compels caution.

27

points. But equally, the machine ought to have some degree of freedom to choose its own preferred states.
Who are we to say that the machine must be a bliss machine, rather than one that wants to feel sadness,
loneliness, or heartbreak? Clearly, a much longer and nuanced treatment is warranted for these immense
questions.
Finally, what does our theory say about the function of consciousness? A provocative hypothesis is
that consciousness may be, somewhat ironically, the solution to general intelligence. This is because
epistemic depth facilitates a kind of cognitive bootstrapping. As an agent becomes aware of its own
knowledge and cognitive processes (structure, weighting rules, etc.), it can begin to self-optimize and selfrefine them, leading to ever-increasing levels of intelligence and adaptability. Epistemic depth and the
“beautiful loop” may therefore be the key to the seemingly flexible and unbounded cognitive capabilities
of human beings; and may have been the central evolutionary breakthrough underlying the cognitive
revolution (Harari, 2014).
In a way, epistemic depth is also the hallmark of true introspection. Not just metacognition, but a
genuine, experientially direct, knowing of what one knows as part of the experiential field itself. This raises
an even more contentious but intriguing possibility that contemplative practice and introspective skill boosts
epistemic depth and thereby affords improvements in the ‘general’ nature of a system’s intelligence. This
is because a system that practices self-reflective knowing can perhaps better objectify, opacify, and
therefore interrogate and update their own reality model. If a system has a high degree of introspective or
‘phenomenological expertise’, they may also be better equipped to accurately share what they know (and
what they do not know) with their community, conferring some evolutionary advantages in a form that
sounds a bit like wisdom (Frith, 2010).

11. CONCLUSION
Beautiful Loop Theory offers a computational model of consciousness with an active inference
backbone. Specifically, we proposed three conditions for consciousness: a unified reality model, inferential
competition, and epistemic depth (i.e., hyper-modeling). The theory offers novel insights into various
cognitive processes and states of consciousness, and lends itself to some unusual, but plausible, conclusions
about the nature of artificial general intelligence, the value of introspection, and the functions of
consciousness. The theory is testable and falsifiable at the level of computational modeling, but also in
terms of neural implementation. If the three conditions are met, we ought to see evidence of awareness or
deep epistemicity, as well as success on any Turing-type tests. We should also continue to find evidence of
the three conditions in human brains, and possibly much simpler brains. Crucially, since epistemic depth is
not intrinsically or necessarily a verbal activity, we must remain very cautious about building AI systems
that meet the three conditions and equally careful in concluding that consciousness, especially the minimal
kind, necessitates a system that can convince you that it is conscious.
