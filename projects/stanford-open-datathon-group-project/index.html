I worked with 4 other undergraduates — Jenna Simon, Kopal Mathur, Teddy Sandler, and Masaya Heywood — from 3 different time zones in the United States and Australia over the April 9th-11th 2021 weekend. As a team, we agreed on a research focus. Next, Teddy and I searched for datasets, took observations, and quantitatively verified our hypotheses. Then Jenna and Kopal composed a formal discussion of our research. Finally, Jenna published our findings online. You can view our final website <a href="https://sodp-team114.herokuapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and our Github repo <a href="https://github.com/jennarsimon/sodp-team114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/JacobFV/sodp-team114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> if that repo gets deleted).</p> <p>I’m missing a lot of contributions though. Masaya had informative observations on every step of the project. This was a real learning experience for me in listening and communicating with individuals from nontechnical backgrounds. Below I share my personal written and analytical contributions and cite those that originated from my group members. See the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VO9ZLQQ94SEziAA-xXh6njGIwOnK54GO?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notebook</a> if you’d like to follow along in the exposition below:</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>To combat the overwhelming spread of inaccurate information regarding the pandemic on public platforms (such as social media), our goal is to identify the most prevalent false statements about the vaccine so that they can be purposefully countered with data-driven factual information.</p> <p>Here we identify the continued trend of negative sentiments towards the COVID-19 vaccine using Twitter data. The most prevalent anti-vaccination beliefs are likely to emerge from analyzing tweet content, hashtags, and user engagement since the official declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Isolating these beliefs allows public officials to focus efforts on combating the specific pieces of misinformation that may have the most harmful effect on public health.</p> <h2 id="experiments-and-observations">Experiments and Observations</h2> <h3 id="sentiment-towards-the-covid-vaccine-is-normally-distributed-with-many-borderline-individuals">Sentiment towards the COVID vaccine is normally distributed with many borderline individuals</h3> <p>We began by taking an unbiased sample of the ‘corona_tweets9.csv’ dataset<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> which tabulates twitter statement sentiment towards COVID vaccination for the date of March 26, 2020 12:51 PM - March 27, 2020 11:53 AM, we find it follows a normal distribution (mean = 0.04918822590081064, median = 0.0). Notably, the interquartile range is all positive. However notice the large number of outliers outside a small center:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_1.png" alt=""> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_2.png" alt=""> </div> </div> <p>Since there is a significant spike in the distribution around the mean, we wanted to explore the distribution while excluding -0.05 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.05. We find this significantly shifts the IQR and central tendency. (mean = 0.09570094913863447, median = 0.13392857142857142) Additionally, it qualitatively accentuates the skewness of the vaccination sentiment distribution. However, once the IQR has been adjusted for this new biased sample, few outliers remain. See the following graphics:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_3.png" alt=""> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_4.png" alt=""> </div> </div> <p>Next, we wanted to analyze the distribution of strictly negative sentiment. We arbitrarily chose x &lt;= -0.05 as our data filter. Repeating the above procedure, we observe a large shift in central tendencies suggesting a large proportion of negative sentiment towards the vaccine. (mean = -0.30970065211674563, median = -0.22083333333333333). See the following figures:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_5.png" alt=""> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_6.png" alt=""> </div> </div> <p>Finally, we compare the negative case with the opposite. Filtering for x &gt;= 0.05, the mean = 0.3124805752967794 and the median = 0.25. We found it surprising that the right tail (x&gt;=0.05) has a lower absolute change in mean than the left (x&lt;=-0.05) since earlier we observed that the unbiased sample has a completely nonnegative IQR.</p> <p>The above observations suggest that there are many borderline positive sentiment twitter statements while the fewer number of negative sentiment tweets are on average more negative than the positive sentiment statements are positive.</p> <h3 id="twitter-sentiment-towards-the-covid-vaccine-follows-an-oscillatory-trend">Twitter sentiment towards the COVID vaccine follows an oscillatory trend</h3> <p>Our next observational study focused on the temporal evolution of COVID vaccine sentiment. This experiment used the Covid Vaccine Tweets <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> which collects tweets made with the hashtag #CovidVaccine. For technical reasons, we were only able to explore a very small subset of this data (15 Aug 2020 - 18 Aug 2020), yet we were still surprised by the mean sentiment trend. Initially, we hypothesized mean sentiment towards the COVID vaccine to remain stable. However observing its evolution, we found an oscillatory - perhaps critical - behavior. We present this data in both raw and savgol smoothed (window_length = 51, polyorder = 3) line plots below:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_7.png" alt=""> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_8.png" alt=""> </div> </div> <p>We do not believe the time series suggests a rapid shift of general opinion. Rather, we believe it identifies fundamental divergence of Twitter activity by COVID vaccine sentiment. Perhaps these oscillations also indicate overall balanced conversation bouncing back-and-forth with pro- and anti- vaccine statements.</p> <h3 id="twitter-statements-towards-the-covid-vaccine-cluster-semantically">Twitter statements towards the COVID vaccine cluster semantically</h3> <p>Our last experiment studied the semantic content of #CovidVaccine tweets using the same dataset as above. This time, for technical reasons we filtered the first 273 elements of the dataset that had a strictly negative (x &lt;= -0.05) sentiment. We used the BERT language model to construct 768-dimensional vector representations of each tweet. Since BERT is trained by unsupervised masked token autoencoding, we expect similar Twitter statements to have similar vector values. To find the clusters of similar statements, we used the Python library hypertools<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> to graph 3D embeddings of each tweet vector representation using k-means clustering. Please see our 3D visualization and the accompanying statements for k=10 clusters. In the first graph, we cluster by the last BERT token embedding on its final self-attention layer and in the second graph we show clusters when all final layer token values are pooled across the sequence.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_9.png" alt=""> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_10.png" alt=""> </div> </div> <p>Since the last token embedding clusters - our first image - showed greater cluster separateness, we employ it for qualitative analysis of Twitter sentiment. Confirming our hypothesis that COVID vaccine statements do cluster semantically, we find relatively uniform cluster sizes of {|N_i|}0&lt;=i&lt;10 = {37, 45, 9, 51, 56, 24, 54, 2, 22, 29} indicating that there are few outlier statements. For the reader’s pleasure, we have included the full clustered textual data in Appendix A. To further test our cluster claim, we perform the above visual analysis on a disjoint subset of data taken from the same dataset (index 400 - 999) and observe similar visualizations for k = 10 clusters:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_11.png" alt=""> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/covid_12.png" alt=""> </div> </div> <p>As an unintended side effect of the sentence-level vector embedding clustering approach we selected, some clusters form with a central idea that arguably has nothing in common with COVID. For example, cluster 0 in Appendix A appears to wander around thoughts pertaining to different countries without necessarily centering on disparity of policy, vaccination rollouts, etc.</p> <h2 id="conclusions-and-future-research">Conclusions and future research</h2> <p>Our SODP Team 114’s conclusion<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> was:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We feel the above observations identify a strong mistrust in the scientific understanding of the COVID-19 vaccine development process and the Government, with a belief in the scientific mismanagement of vaccine initiatives. Public perception of the vaccine rollout and its swift development process stems from the belief that the initiative may attempt to pacify the pandemic without considering public welfare and easing long-term effects.</p> <p>With the aid of social media platforms, information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic reaches people from a wide range of demographics. The reception of information by each demographic is dependent on their level of intuition and reflection when consuming media content; a lack of this may motivate the panic-driven spread of false information.</p> <p>Increasing public trust in the vaccine requires increasing the public’s understanding of the vaccine. By focusing education efforts on clarifying the vaccine’s development process, rather than trying to disprove each myth surrounding the vaccine, officials can most efficiently increase public support of the vaccination initiative in the interest of general health.”</p> </blockquote> <p>If our analysis extended to temporal series, we would expect to observe echo-chain networks emerge.</p> <p>In the future, we would like to explore:</p> <ul> <li>What bias does Twitter introduce by its user pool compared to other social networking platforms?</li> <li>How does COVID vaccine sentiment cluster demographically and psychographically?</li> <li>What factors are associated with individuals who play a role as large hubs promoting anti-vaccination sentiment on twitter?</li> </ul> <h2 id="appendix-a-cluster-statements">Appendix A: Cluster statements</h2> <p>Note to the reader: We do not filter these Twitter statements for language, profanity, or other content metrics to minimally bias our data.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Looking at cluster 0 with 37 elements:
