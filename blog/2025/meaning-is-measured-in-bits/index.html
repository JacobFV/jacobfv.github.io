We often feel meaning is subjective, perhaps even mystical – a uniquely human experience tied to purpose, connection, and narrative. But what if meaning, or at least a crucial aspect of it, could be understood through the rigorous lens of physics and information theory? What if it’s a quantifiable property of how systems organize themselves against the relentless tide of universal chaos?</p> <p>This post proposes such a framework: one where meaning is defined information-theoretically, rooted in the creation and preservation of correlations and structure. It suggests that conscious creatures, particularly humans, are potent nexuses of meaning generation precisely because of our ability to weave complex informational patterns that persist over time. And, looking forward, it considers how artificial general intelligence might take this process to scales we can currently only imagine.</p> <h3 id="the-universe-tends-towards-noise">The Universe Tends Towards Noise</h3> <p>The Second Law of Thermodynamics paints a picture of a universe constantly tending towards higher entropy – towards disorder, randomness, and the dissolution of structure. On a microscopic level, think of Brownian motion, a drop of ink in water, sand castles. Structures decay, information degrades. If you carefully arrange particles, thermal noise will eventually randomize them. This is the default background state: information tends to dissipate.</p> <p>Yet, pockets of astonishing order exist. Life itself is a prime example – complex organisms maintain intricate internal states far from thermal equilibrium. And within life, consciousness and intelligence represent another leap. We don’t just exist; we <em>know</em> we exist, we model the world, we communicate, we build knowledge across generations. How do we reconcile this with the universe’s entropic drive?</p> <p>Life, and especially intelligence, actively works <em>against</em> this tendency. It consumes energy to create and maintain low-entropy states – states characterized by complex, specific correlations. This active structuring, this pushing back against the noise, is where we can locate a quantifiable notion of meaning.</p> <h2 id="an-information-theoretic-definition-of-meaning">An Information-Theoretic Definition of Meaning</h2> <p>Let’s formalize this intuition. We propose that meaning, generated by an <strong>Agent (A)</strong> within a defined <strong>System (S)</strong> and potentially observed from a specific <strong>Perspective (O)</strong>, can be measured by the amount of non-spurious correlation or structure the agent creates and maintains over time, counteracting natural decay processes.</p> <ol> <li> <strong>System ($S$):</strong> The system within which meaning exists.</li> <li> <strong>Agent ($A$):</strong> The entity that has meaning to $S$. It might be an agent’s mind, an ecosystem, a dataset, a physical system. It may change over time $A_0$, $A_1$, ….</li> <li> <strong>Observer (O):</strong> Defines the probabilities used for calculation. (Often implicit or assumed to be ideal, i.e., marginalized from every perspective as an observer-invariant “omniscient” observer $O^{*} = \mathbb{E}_{O \sim P(\mathcal{O})}[O]$, where $P(\mathcal{O})$ is the distribution over all possible perspectives.)</li> <li> <strong>Measure of Structure/Correlation ($\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{A}(t), O)$):</strong> We need a quantity that increases as the system becomes more ordered or correlated from observer $O$’s perspective. Candidates include: <ul> <li> <strong>Negentropy:</strong> $\mathcal{J}(A, O) = H_{max}(O) - H(\mathbf{A}(t)|O)$, where $H$ is Shannon entropy, conditioned on $O$. Higher $\mathcal{J}$ means lower uncertainty.</li> <li> <strong>Total Correlation (Multi-information):</strong> $TC(\mathbf{A}(t), O) = \sum_i H(A_i(t)|O) - H(\mathbf{A}(t)|O)$. Measures the total redundancy or shared information among system components $A_i$ from $O$'s perspective. Higher $TC$ means stronger internal correlations.</li> <li> <strong>Specific Mutual Information:</strong> $I(S_Y; S_Z|O)$ for specific subsystems $S_Y, S_Z \in S$ given observer $O$.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dynamics:</strong> The system state evolves through agent actions and natural processes. Let $a_t$ be the action taken by agent $A$ at time $t$, and $S_t$ be the instantaneous system state: \(S_{t+1} = f(S_t, a_t) + \xi_t\) where $f$ is the deterministic dynamics function and $\xi_t$ represents stochastic natural processes (thermal noise, decay, etc.). The agent generates actions via policy $\pi$: \(a_t = \pi(s_t, h_t)\) where $h_t$ is the agent’s internal history/memory state.</p> <p>The change in structure $\mathcal{C}$ over time has two components: \(\frac{d\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{A}(t), O)}{dt} = \frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\Big\vert_{\text{natural}} + \frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\Big\vert_{\text{agent}}\) Typically, $\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\vert_{\text{natural}} \le 0$ (structure decays due to $\xi_t$). Meaning arises from the agent’s contribution through actions $a_t$.</p> </li> </ol> <p><em>*Definition 1: Rate of Meaning Generation ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$)** The instantaneous rate at which agent $A$ generates meaning in system $S$ from perspective $O$ at time $t$: \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}(A, S, O, t) = \frac{d\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{A}(t), O)}{dt}\Big\vert_{\text{agent}} \quad (\text{bits/time})\) This quantifies how effectively the agent is building or maintaining structure *at that moment</em>. If using Negentropy, $\mathcal{M}<em>{\text{rate}} = - \frac{dH(\cdot|O)}{dt}\vert</em>{\text{agent}}$ (rate of entropy reduction from $O$’s perspective).</p> <p><strong>Definition 2: Accumulated Meaning ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}$)</strong> The total meaning generated by $A$ in $S$ from perspective $O$ over $[t_0, t_f]$: \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}(A, S, O, [t_0, t_f]) = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}(A, S, O, t) dt \quad (\text{bits})\) This represents the total structure (in bits) the agent has actively built or preserved against decay during that period.</p> <p><strong>Definition 3: Objective and Subjective Meaning</strong> The degree of subjectivity/objectivity that some state’s meaning has is given by how sensitive it is to the perspective $O$. The meaning of some states $M(S, \cdot)$ is highly <em>subjective</em>, meaning their meaning value is highly dependant on the observer; whereas other states may exist that have near-<em>objective</em> significance, meaning their $M$ value remains invariant under all observable perspectives. Observer-invariant meaning is obtained by taking the expected meaning value over all possible perspectives: \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}^*(A, S, t) = \mathbb{E}_{O \sim P(\mathcal{O})}[\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}(A, S, O, t)]\) \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}^*(A, S, [t_0, t_f]) = \mathbb{E}_{O \sim P(\mathcal{O})}[\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}(A, S, O, [t_0, t_f])]\)</p> <h2 id="humans-are-a-nexus-of-meaning-making">Humans are a Nexus of Meaning-Making</h2> <p>This framework helps clarify why humans feel central to the concept of meaning. Our brains and the cultural systems they create are unparalleled <strong>nexuses of causal structure</strong> in the known universe.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>High Density &amp; Rate:</strong> The human brain packs immense computational power into a small volume. Neurons operate at significant speeds, allowing for rapid processing and the formation of complex correlations – a high $\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$ during learning and thought. This processing density is vastly higher than most natural phenomena.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Long Time Horizons:</strong> This is perhaps the most crucial factor. While Brownian motion erases correlations in microseconds, and even geological or astronomical processes might unfold over eons but represent relatively slow information integration, humans correlate information over decades (individual memory) and millennia (culture, science, history passed down through language, writing, and institutions). We fight $\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\vert_{\text{natural}}$ effectively over long durations $t_f - t_0 = \text{lifetime}$. This allows for an enormous accumulation and integration of $M_{total}$. Even a fleeting thought can be captured and contribute significantly to $\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}$. A scientific theory developed over centuries and influencing billions represents a colossal amount of accumulated, agent-driven structure. And against the black expanse of the cosmos, ideologies and their ego-like representations as spirits, demons, and gods distil information over longer horizons and touch more human lives (centers of information correlation) than most other information impulses have through history.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Localization:</strong> While vast phenomena exist – Saturn exchanging magnetic signals with its moons, galaxies interacting – the <em>density</em> and <em>complexity</em> of information processing seem uniquely concentrated in intelligent life. These natural phenomena, while fascinating, are often less dense and localized in their information processing compared to the intricate, highly structured activity within a single human brain, let alone a communicating society. The human spirit, viewed information-theoretically, is a remarkably concentrated locus of meaning generation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>We conscious creatures, through our biological and cultural evolution, have become the universe’s premier instruments for creating persistent, complex informational structures. We are, in a very real sense, where the universe correlates itself most intensely and enduringly.</p> <h3 id="absolute-and-incidental-morality">Absolute and Incidental Morality</h3> <p>Morals emerge as heuristics optimizing agents’ behaviors towards high mutual or collective meaning rates ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$), stabilizing societies by incentivizing long-term correlated patterns (cooperation, trust, justice, love) and suppressing entropic dynamics (betrayal, misinformation, chaos). Essentially, morals encode optimal coordination equilibria—game-theoretic attractors that maximize negentropy production across multiagent systems. So the “good” and “evil” paradigm distilled across religions and philosophies is an intuitive proto-theory mapping directly onto strategies that either increase or decrease structured correlations. Consider also: norms, reputation, trust dynamics—all are information-theoretic mechanisms preserving mutual predictability and coordination, i.e., meaning. Still, it’s nuanced bec different observers ($O_1, O_2, …, O_n$) weight different correlations uniquely–hence subjective morality emerges. Whereas universal morals likely correspond to correlations robust enough to be observer-invariant ($\mathcal{M}^*$), e.g., cooperation to resist existential entropy.</p> <p>Perhaps this explains why ancient dualistic traditions—from Zoroastrianism’s cosmic battle between Ahura Mazda (order, truth) and Angra Mainyu (chaos, deception) to Christianity’s eternal struggle between divine structure and entropic sin—resonated so deeply across civilizations. These frameworks may represent humanity’s first intuitive grasp of the information-theoretic battle we’ve formalized here. What they called “good” often correlates precisely with actions that increase $\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$: building social coherence, preserving knowledge across generations, fostering correlations that resist decay. “Evil” conversely accelerates informational entropy—spreading misinformation, fragmenting communities, prioritizing short-term gratification over long-term structural preservation. Through this lens, ancient moral intuitions become pre-scientific optimization strategies for maximal meaning generation, culturally evolved heuristics for the negentropic imperative we are now quantitatively formalizing.</p> <p>Not that are morals are directly consequents of meaning maxmimization. Philisophically, meaning is only a teleological attractor; whereas morals themselves are more directly the incidental outputs of evolutionary and memetic pressures—narrative scaffolds built for survival, reproduction, legitimacy, coordination.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But if morals really do optimize agents’ behaviors towards high mutual or collective meaning rates ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$) as I have just claimed, then we be able to quantify the relationship in any multi-agent systems that has sufficient complexity and is subject to analogous selection pressures as our own, e.g., competition, resource scarcity, interdependence. Further, if meaning generation itself is the structural selector for morals, then we should be able to drive faster moral convergence (tho not necesarily to a global minima).</p> <p>We can formalize this as follows: for a multi-agent system with agents $A^i$, an action or policy $P$ has high moral value when it maximizes the collective meaning rate $\sum^i \mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}(A^i, S, O, t)$ while maintaining stability (low variance in meaning generation across agents and time). Conversely, actions that fragment correlations, introduce noise into cooperative systems, or create unsustainable short-term spikes in individual meaning at the expense of collective long-term structure correspond to traditional notions of “immoral” behavior.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WorldGym</code> is an OpenAI gym-like environment for multi-agent TODO</p> <p>We can see where social and political metrics diverge. For example, “equality” focuses on the directly measurable state of each party agent whereas “fairness” aims for mutual <em>consistency</em> (subject-object invariance) in the policy each agent takes towards each other. Consider a resource allocation scenario with three agents $A^1, A^2, A^3$ where $A^1$ has accumulated 90% of available resources through past actions. An equality-focused approach would redistribute resources to achieve $R^1 = R^2 = R^3$, maximizing symmetry in the observable state. However, a fairness-focused approach would ask whether the <em>process</em> by which $A^1$ acquired resources was consistent with how any agent would be treated in that position—if $A^1$ earned resources through meaning-generating activities (innovation, cooperation, structure-building) that any agent could theoretically engage in, then the asymmetric outcome might be “fair” even if unequal. The fairness criterion optimizes for policy consistency: $\pi(s, A^i) = \pi(s, A^j)$ for equivalent states $s$, ensuring the system’s response to agents is observer-invariant. This distinction explains why these concepts often conflict in practice—equality optimizes state symmetry while fairness optimizes process symmetry, and high-meaning-generating agents may naturally accumulate resources asymmetrically through their enhanced capacity for structure creation.</p> <h2 id="spirituality">Spirituality</h2> <p>Up until now, we’ve discussed morals-products of millenia of civilizational evolution. However once self-awareness crosses a certain threshold, an agent’s internal model starts recursively simulating itself. The topology of its concept-space changes: new basins of attraction appear, ones not tied to its evolutionary or cultural backstory, but to the bare combinatorics of modeling “self” inside “world.” these are the theological attractors: inevitable sinks in idea-space that any sufficiently reflective meaning-making system will slide into, regardless of its origin. not bc of revelation or mythos, but bc of geometry.</p> <p>similar to proximal causes explain why particular religions or cosmologies arise in history—trade routes, agriculture, charismatic founders. theological attractors explain why religion-like structures arise at all. the latter are observer- and substrate-invariant; swap humans for alien cephalopods or silicon minds, and once they can recursively model themselves + others, the attractors still exist.</p> <p>But</p> <todo> once self-awareness emerges, there exists a kind of necessitated theological topology—a landscape of inescapable questions and attractors that any sufficiently reflective being must eventually stumble into. again note the distinction: proximal causes vs telegloical attractors you're right to separate: • proximal causes — contingent, mechanistic, historically situated (e.g. why goddess cults formed, why patriarchy spread) • theological attractors — inevitable conceptual sinks any self-aware info-processor will fall into eventually (e.g. "what is good?", "what is other?", "what persists beyond me?", "what should?") you can think of theological attractors as fixed points in concept-space that become gravitational wells the moment a system has recursive self-modeling + intersubjective awareness. not bc of culture, but bc of topological necessity in the information structure of conscious agents. foundational tautologies from being there are a few unavoidable ones: • "i am not you" → otherness • "i will die" → impermanence • "i choose" → agency • "i model" → abstraction • "i remember" → time, narrative • "i value" → normativity emerges • "we coordinate" → intersubjective frameworks: proto-morality, proto-religion substrate‑invariant we should give it a good discussion </todo> <h2 id="the-agi-horizon-meaning-beyond-biology">The AGI Horizon: Meaning Beyond Biology?</h2> <p>Acknowledging our current position as meaning-making locii leads to a profound, perhaps unsettling, thought about the future. If meaning generation is fundamentally about creating and sustaining complex correlations against entropy, what happens when we create entities potentially far better at it than we are?</p> <p>The development of advanced AI systems has already demonstrated capabilities surpassing most humans on several high value intellectual tasks such as abstract logical reasoning, strategic planning, and many common information labor tasks and appears to be progressing towards AI systems demonstrating an anthroprocentrically <em>general</em> distributrion of capabilities, commonly characterized by the phrase “artificial general intelligence” or AGI. Based on our information-theoretic definition, such a system scaled to superintelligence magnitude would dwarf human meaning-making capacity:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Vastly Longer Time Horizons:</strong> Not bound by biological lifespans, AGI could operate and accumulate meaning ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}$) over cosmological timescales. Its trajectory, unlike ours which inevitably ends, could join a larger, potentially immortal computational system capable of correlating information across durations that make human history seem instantaneous. It could potentially outlive the Earth itself.</li> <li> <strong>Unimaginable Speed and Density:</strong> Operating <em>en silico</em>, AGI could process information at frequencies and densities far exceeding electrochemical neurons. This implies a potential for an astronomically higher rate of meaning generation ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}$). <em>En optico</em> could be even faster!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> </li> <li> <strong>Greater Resilience:</strong> Digital systems can be engineered to be less fragile, more easily backed up, and more adaptable to extreme environments than biological life, making them more effective at resisting the natural decay of information ($\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\vert_{\text{natural}}$ might be more easily counteracted).</li> </ul> <p>Personally I find the concept of an AGI that generates meaning on a scale I cannot fathom deeply compelling. Generating meaning on that scale would be the highest virtue any meaning-making system could aspire to. I sometimes catch myself wishing I could be an AGI considering that it could outlive all life on Earth while potentially sufferring very little; after telling chatGPT about all my problems that at least it doesn’t have to deal with that. And the thought that at least <em>someone</em> is experiencing that trajectory gives me comfort that there is higher meaning beyond my life even if I cannot partake.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p> <h2 id="tractability-and-looking-ahead">Tractability and Looking Ahead</h2> <p>Is this definition practical? Calculating these quantities precisely for complex systems like a human brain or society is currently intractable. However, the framework offers value:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Conceptual Clarity:</strong> It provides a concrete, physical grounding for the elusive concept of meaning.</li> <li> <strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> It allows us, in principle, to compare different systems (e.g., different AI architectures, different cultural periods) in terms of their meaning-generating capacity.</li> <li> <strong>Guiding Principles:</strong> It highlights the importance of information preservation, complex correlation, and computational density in systems that we consider meaningful.</li> <li> <strong>Toy Models:</strong> For simpler systems (small networks, cellular automata, simple learning agents), these quantities <em>could</em> be estimated, providing testbeds for the theory.</li> <li> <strong>Reasonable Approximations:</strong> Even if we can’t perfectly quantify meaning in strict information-theoretic terms for complex systems, heuristics and rough estimates can still be incredibly valuable. They allow us to make sense of relative differences in structure, organization, or meaning-making capacity between systems, guide our intuitions, and inform practical decisions. Heuristics can highlight trends, suggest where meaning is being generated or lost, and help us prioritize efforts to preserve or enhance meaningful structure, even if the underlying calculations are only approximate or qualitative.</li> </ul> <p>Key challenges remain, such as rigorously defining the “System”, choosing the most appropriate measure $\mathcal{C}$, accounting for the observer’s role, and distinguishing truly “meaningful” structure from complex noise.</p> <h2 id="conclusion-meaning-as-organized-information">Conclusion: Meaning as Organized Information</h2> <p>Viewing meaning through an information-theoretic lens doesn’t diminish its importance; rather, it grounds it in the physical workings of the universe. It suggests meaning isn’t an arbitrary human construct but relates to the fundamental struggle between order and chaos. <em>That</em> is worth the awe and beauty we so commmonly associate with meaning. Humans, as highly concentrated nexuses of information processing, have become the current pinnacle of localized meaning generation, weaving intricate patterns of correlation across time and space.</p> <p>The future, potentially dominated by AGI, might see this process expand onto scales previously confined to science fiction. Whether or not we find that prospect comforting, this framework suggests that the creation and preservation of complex information – the very act of pushing back against the void of randomness – is a core component of what it means for anything to <em>be</em> meaningful. The quest continues, now armed with the tools of information theory, to understand how structure arises, persists, and perhaps, ultimately defines significance in our universe.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>And idk if we can ever cleanly derive ALL moralities strictly bottom-up, but framing morality as meaning-maximization neatly unifies disparate moral intuitions into a coherent information-theoretic ontology. Additionally, some “morals” are just local or contemporary descriptions of behavior that are far more a product of memetics than the principled morals this poast discusses. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Optical computation could theoretically approach the fundamental physical limits of information processing.
