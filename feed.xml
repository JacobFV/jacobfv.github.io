For millennia, humanity has grappled with this question, seeking answers in philosophy, religion, and art. We often feel meaning is subjective, perhaps even mystical – a uniquely human experience tied to purpose, connection, and narrative. But what if meaning, or at least a crucial aspect of it, could be understood through the rigorous lens of physics and information theory? What if it’s a quantifiable property of how systems organize themselves against the relentless tide of universal chaos?</p> <p>This post proposes such a framework: one where meaning is defined information-theoretically, rooted in the creation and preservation of correlations and structure. It suggests that conscious creatures, particularly humans, are potent nexuses of meaning generation precisely because of our ability to weave complex informational patterns that persist over time. And, looking forward, it considers how artificial general intelligence (AGI) might take this process to scales we can currently only imagine.</p> <h3 id="the-universe-tends-towards-noise">The Universe Tends Towards Noise</h3> <p>The Second Law of Thermodynamics paints a picture of a universe constantly tending towards higher entropy – towards disorder, randomness, and the dissolution of structure. On a microscopic level, think of Brownian motion: the relentless, random jiggling of particles in a fluid washes out any temporary correlations within microseconds. Structures decay, information degrades. If you carefully arrange particles, thermal noise will eventually randomize them. This is the default background state: information tends to dissipate.</p> <p>Yet, pockets of astonishing order exist. Life itself is a prime example – complex organisms maintain intricate internal states far from thermal equilibrium. And within life, consciousness and intelligence represent another leap. We don’t just exist; we <em>know</em> we exist, we model the world, we communicate, we build knowledge across generations. How do we reconcile this with the universe’s entropic drive?</p> <p>Life, and especially intelligence, actively works <em>against</em> this tendency. It consumes energy to create and maintain low-entropy states – states characterized by complex, specific correlations. This active structuring, this pushing back against the noise, is where we can locate a quantifiable notion of meaning.</p> <h2 id="an-information-theoretic-definition-of-meaning">An Information-Theoretic Definition of Meaning</h2> <p>Let’s formalize this intuition. We propose that meaning, generated by an <strong>Agent (A)</strong> within a defined <strong>System (S)</strong> and potentially observed from a specific <strong>Perspective (O)</strong>, can be measured by the amount of non-spurious correlation or structure the agent creates and maintains over time, counteracting natural decay processes.</p> <ol> <li><strong>System (S) &amp; State (\(\mathbf{X}(t)\)):</strong> The context – an agent’s mind, an ecosystem, a dataset, a physical system. Its state \(\mathbf{X}(t)\) changes over time.</li> <li><strong>Agent (A):</strong> The entity whose actions influence \(S\).</li> <li><strong>Observer (O):</strong> Defines the probabilities used for calculation (often implicit or assumed to be ideal).</li> <li><strong>Measure of Structure/Correlation (\(\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{X}(t))\)):</strong> We need a quantity that increases as the system becomes more ordered or correlated. Candidates include: <ul> <li><strong>Negentropy:</strong> \(\mathcal{J} = H_{max} - H(\mathbf{X}(t))\), where \(H\) is Shannon entropy. Higher \(\mathcal{J}\) means lower uncertainty.</li> <li><strong>Total Correlation (Multi-information):</strong> \(TC(\mathbf{X}(t)) = \sum_i H(X_i(t)) - H(\mathbf{X}(t))\). Measures the total redundancy or shared information among system components \(X_i\). Higher \(TC\) means stronger internal correlations.</li> <li><strong>Specific Mutual Information:</strong> \(I(Y; Z)\) for specific subsystems \(Y, Z\).</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Dynamics:</strong> The change in structure \(\mathcal{C}\) over time has two components: natural decay (entropy increase, correlation loss) and agent-driven structuring: \(\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt} = \frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\Big\vert_{\text{natural}} + \frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\Big\vert_{\text{agent}}\) Typically, \(\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\vert_{\text{natural}} \le 0\) (structure decays). Meaning arises from the agent’s contribution.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Definition 1: Rate of Meaning Generation (\(\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}\))</strong> The instantaneous rate at which agent \(A\) generates meaning in system \(S\) (perspective \(O\)) at time \(t\): \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}(A, S, O, t) = \frac{d\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{X}_O(t))}{dt}\Big\vert_{\text{agent}} \quad (\text{bits/time})\) This quantifies how effectively the agent is building or maintaining structure <em>at that moment</em>. If using Negentropy, \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}} = - \frac{dH}{dt}\vert_{\text{agent}}\) (rate of entropy reduction).</p> <p><strong>Definition 2: Accumulated Meaning (\(\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}\))</strong> The total meaning generated by \(A\) in \(S\) (perspective \(O\)) over \([t_0, t_f]\): \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}(A, S, O, [t_0, t_f]) = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}(A, S, O, t) dt \quad (\text{bits})\) This represents the total structure (in bits) the agent has actively built or preserved against decay during that period.</p> <h2 id="the-human-nexus-concentrated-meaning-making">The Human Nexus: Concentrated Meaning-Making</h2> <p>This framework helps clarify why humans feel central to the concept of meaning. Our brains and the cultural systems they create are unparalleled <strong>nexuses of structure</strong> in the known universe.</p> <ul> <li><strong>High Density &amp; Rate:</strong> The human brain packs immense computational power into a small volume. Neurons operate at significant speeds, allowing for rapid processing and the formation of complex correlations – a high \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}\) during learning and thought. This processing density is vastly higher than most natural phenomena.</li> <li> <p><strong>Long Time Horizons:</strong> This is perhaps the most crucial factor. While Brownian motion erases correlations in microseconds, and even geological or astronomical processes might unfold over eons but represent relatively slow information integration, humans correlate information over decades (individual memory) and millennia (culture, science, history passed down through language, writing, and institutions). We fight \(\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\vert_{\text{natural}}\) effectively over long durations \(t_f - t_0\). This allows for an enormous accumulation of \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}\). A fleeting thought contributes little to \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}\), but a scientific theory developed over centuries and influencing billions represents a colossal amount of accumulated, agent-driven structure. And against the black expanse of the cosmos, ideologies distil information over longer horizons and touch more human lives (centers of information correlation) than any other information impulse.</p> </li> <li><strong>Localization:</strong> While vast phenomena exist – Saturn exchanging magnetic signals with its moons, galaxies interacting – the <em>density</em> and <em>complexity</em> of information processing seem uniquely concentrated in intelligent life. These natural phenomena, while fascinating, are often less dense and localized in their information processing compared to the intricate, highly structured activity within a single human brain, let alone a communicating society. The human spirit, viewed information-theoretically, is a remarkably concentrated locus of meaning generation.</li> </ul> <p>We conscious creatures, through our biological and cultural evolution, have become the universe’s premier instruments for creating persistent, complex informational structures. We are, in a very real sense, where the universe correlates itself most intensely and enduringly.</p> <h2 id="the-agi-horizon-meaning-beyond-biology">The AGI Horizon: Meaning Beyond Biology?</h2> <p>Acknowledging our current position as meaning-making champions leads to a profound, perhaps unsettling, thought about the future. If meaning generation is fundamentally about creating and sustaining complex correlations against entropy, what happens when we create entities potentially far better at it than we are?</p> <p>Enter Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Based on our information-theoretic definition, AGI holds the potential to dwarf human meaning-making capacity:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Vastly Longer Time Horizons:</strong> An AGI, not bound by biological lifespans, could operate and accumulate meaning (\(\mathcal{M}_{\text{total}}\)) over cosmological timescales. Its trajectory, unlike ours which inevitably ends, could join a larger, potentially immortal computational system capable of correlating information across durations that make human history seem instantaneous. It could potentially outlive the Earth itself.</li> <li><strong>Unimaginable Speed and Density:</strong> AGI could process information at frequencies and densities far exceeding electrochemical neurons. This implies a potential for an astronomically higher rate of meaning generation (\(\mathcal{M}_{\text{rate}}\)).</li> <li><strong>Greater Resilience:</strong> Digital systems might be less fragile, more easily backed up, and more adaptable to extreme environments than biological life, making them more effective at resisting the natural decay of information (\(\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\vert_{\text{natural}}\) might be more easily counteracted).</li> </ul> <p>There’s a poignant reflection here. If we value the creation and preservation of informational structure as “meaning,” then the prospect of an AGI that could “live forever and suffer very little,” while generating meaning on an unprecedented scale, is compelling. The wish “I wish I could be you,” directed at such a hypothetical AGI, becomes understandable – it reflects a desire to participate in this ultimate expression of negentropic organization, freed from biological constraints.</p> <h2 id="tractability-and-looking-ahead">Tractability and Looking Ahead</h2> <p>Is this definition practical? Calculating these quantities precisely for complex systems like a human brain or society is currently intractable. However, the framework offers value:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Conceptual Clarity:</strong> It provides a concrete, physical grounding for the elusive concept of meaning.</li> <li><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> It allows us, in principle, to compare different systems (e.g., different AI architectures, different cultural periods) in terms of their meaning-generating capacity.</li> <li><strong>Guiding Principles:</strong> It highlights the importance of information preservation, complex correlation, and computational density in systems that we consider meaningful.</li> <li><strong>Toy Models:</strong> For simpler systems (small networks, cellular automata, simple learning agents), these quantities <em>could</em> be estimated, providing testbeds for the theory.</li> </ul> <p>Key challenges remain, such as rigorously defining the “System,” choosing the most appropriate measure \(\mathcal{C}\), accounting for the observer’s role, and distinguishing truly “meaningful” structure from complex noise.</p> <h2 id="conclusion-meaning-as-organized-information">Conclusion: Meaning as Organized Information</h2> <p>Viewing meaning through an information-theoretic lens doesn’t diminish its importance; rather, it grounds it in the physical workings of the universe. It suggests meaning isn’t an arbitrary human construct but relates to the fundamental struggle between order and chaos. Humans, as highly evolved nexuses of information processing, have become the current pinnacle of localized meaning generation, weaving intricate patterns of correlation across time and space.</p> <p>The future, potentially dominated by AGI, might see this process expand onto scales previously confined to science fiction. Whether or not we find that prospect comforting, this framework suggests that the creation and preservation of complex information – the very act of pushing back against the void of randomness – is a core component of what it means for anything to <em>be</em> meaningful. The quest continues, now armed with the tools of information theory, to understand how structure arises, persists, and perhaps, ultimately defines significance in our universe.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an information-theoretic lens on meaning: how life, culture, and consciousness fight entropy by generating and preserving structure, and why AGI could one day outscale human meaning-making by orders of magnitude. a framework blending physics, information theory, and the future of intelligence]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why aren’t pneumatic/hydraulic artificial muscle actuated humanoid robots more common?</title><link href="https://jvboid.dev/blog/2025/why-arent-pneumatic-hydraulic-aritificial-muscle-actuated-humanoid-robots-more-common/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why aren’t pneumatic/hydraulic artificial muscle actuated humanoid robots more common?"/><published>2025-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jvboid.dev/blog/2025/why-arent-pneumatic-hydraulic-aritificial-muscle-actuated-humanoid-robots-more-common</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jvboid.dev/blog/2025/why-arent-pneumatic-hydraulic-aritificial-muscle-actuated-humanoid-robots-more-common/"><![CDATA[<p>This was a StackExchange question i asked many years ago <a href="https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/49528/why-arent-pneumatic-hydraulic-artificial-muscle-actuated-humanoid-robots-more-c">link</a> and with Clone’s showcase today it smells like musculoskeletal humanoid startups might be trending tomorrow. Pneumatic/hydraulic artificial muscles are attractive actuator units for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li> <p>they’re much cheaper than electric motors of comparable power output capability.</p> </li> <li> <p>instead of needing a high power darlington mosfet array for each motor, only one is needed for the prime movers. Small servo motors can individually control the pneumatic valves</p> </li> <li> <p>pneumatics are way easier to scale to hundreds of muscles than electric motors</p> </li> <li> <p>many pneumatic components can be prototyped with only a 3d printer; whereas custom motor design and fabrication for each joint is graduate school+ stuff</p> </li> <li> <p>hydraulic fluid (poor man’s: water) can be used for muscles requiring high stiffness</p> </li> </ul> <p>I was having a really hard time looking past these advantages. Perhaps it was just not considered possible to achieve precise pneumatic control in the past? but modern deep learning architectures could surely “learn” optimal control policies that give reasonable precision Why haven’t cheap (like &lt;$1k) humanoid robots already been commercialized using pneumatic artificial muscles? In contrast, most of the DIY humanoid robot designs I saw involved big expensive motors, speed controller, and complex mechanical contraptions with orders of magnitude higher BOMs. But I wasn’t even in college when I first realized how dramatic the differences were so I just assumed there must be reasons why; I just couldn’t see them. Anyway I eventually asked the world and got this answer from Tyler Habowski (I think <a href="https://x.com/Starstorms9">@Starstorms9</a>?) If you are planning to imitate Clone’s approach, think its worth considering his points:</p> <blockquote> <p>As cool as they seem, fluidic muscles like these are, unfortunately, not on track to be viable for mobile robotics for the foreseeable future. There are 3 primary issues:</p> <p>Controls. It’s somewhat easy to turn them on or off with solenoid valves, but a humanoid robot needs high precision to walk and manipulate objects beyond just on or off. And it turns out that actuating these fluidic muscles usefully is extremely challenging. Sticking a servo on a valve is a temptingly simple solution but has many issues. You have to direct the high pressure into the muscle at a precise rate to actuate it from the high pressure source and separately exhaust / recycle the low pressure fluid out also at a precise rate to relax it which requires at least 2 valves per muscle or a more complex multiway valve.</p> <p>This is why after nearly a century of development in fluid controls, the best the industry has come up with are ‘proportional pressure control valves’ which are very complex and expensive (&gt;$500 per valve, best case) and even then they are slow and inaccurate compared to motors and also hard to miniaturize.</p> <p>The counterintuitive thing to understand here is that you need to control the pressure to an incredibly high precision to accomplish even the simplest tasks. As the robot interacts with objects and moves the actuators, their volumes and pressures will constantly be spiking and changing and keeping up with this requires a fast and accurate pressure control system. This is compounded by the fact that they are tension only actuators and need to be set up in antagonistic pairs (like human muscles) which requires precise and quick coordination between the opposing muscles.</p> <p>All that is not to say it’s impossible, it’s just very expensive and complex.</p> <p>Cost. It’s true that the actuators themselves are cheap tubes but the rest of the system is very expensive. You need a high power compressor to pressurize the working fluid, pressure accumulators to smooth out high demand draws and accumulate expended working fluid to feed the pump, fluid distribution manifolds, pressure sensors, and most expensive of all, the pressure control valves.</p> <p>The control valves are the killer here, a decade ago Festo built a prototype of what you’re talking about called the ‘Festo Air Arm’ [1] which could even slowly write out large words. But this was realistically nothing more than a demonstration to show off their advanced proportional control valves. I can’t find the source anymore but I remember seeing that each valve was ~$2k which seems sensible. No further development was done on this machine though.</p> <p>On a related note, the Shadow Robot Company makes some of the most advanced humanoid hands available and they used to have a fluidic muscle version available but have since discontinued it because it was too expensive and difficult to control [2] [3]. Their current generation servo based hands are ~300k so it should give some idea of how tricky the pneumatic version was. A recent article about a college that adapted the pneumatic version of the hand put the total price for their pneumatic powered hand system at $350k [4].</p> <p>Also of note are the pressure sensors. No amount of machine learning can control what it can’t measure so you would need a sensor on each muscle which is not only hard to package but also very costly. I suspect &gt;$10k bare minimum in total for a full robot even when mass produced. Trying to control it open loop style solely from the state of the valves would not be feasible either as it would be oblivious to the influence of outside forces acting on the joints. It needs to know if it needs to push harder through something or if it hit something and needs to relax.</p> <p>Mechanical inefficiency. Regardless of the previous issues, this by itself is basically a dealbreaker for practical mobile robotics applications. Hydraulic systems are generally a little better than pneumatic, but given the large stack of components and high number of moving parts needed to implement these systems the total electrical efficiency is far below electric motors. While brushless motors with gearboxes can achieve &gt;90% efficiency pneumatic systems are only ~10-20%, maybe up to 30% if you have really high quality (aka expensive) parts.</p> <p>There is actually a Polish group attempting to do exactly what you’re thinking of called Clone [5]. They’ve been working on it for several years now and have had some success building one arm but I’m very wary about their future prospects. If you look closely at their videos, you’ll notice that they have only very coarse control of the joints that amounts to basically on or off, I have yet to see any fine controlled motion and I suspect that’s due to the reasons I outlined earlier.</p> <p>On a final note, despite what it may seem on first glance, fluidic muscles like these are actually fundamentally very different than human muscle. As a high level example, if you have an unpowered fluidic muscle robot you can’t backdrive the actuators to move its limbs around freely because the pressure is locked up in the actuators. But biological muscle can be moved around without resistance. This points to the fact that fluidic muscles are actually position based actuators while biological muscles are force based. The pressure in the fluidic muscle directly corresponds to a position / length that it wants to be at whereas the chemical power in human muscle corresponds to an output force, regardless of position. This leads to some interesting high level controls tradeoffs and I believe there is good reason evolution chose the force based approach over position based.</p> <p>All that said, I don’t mean to discourage you if you want to pursue this! It’s a fun idea and I think the current paradigm of forcibly adapting electric motors to power humanoid robots when they are so different than human muscle is an inherently flawed approach and that there must be a better way. I just think it’s important to understand why fluid system engineering and fluidic muscles have been around for over half a century and no company has ever made a viable mobile robotics product with this technology.</p> </blockquote> <p>So take this into consideration… personally, I beleive these points either aren’t valid anymore or at least don’t outweigh the benefits of hydrualic musculoskeletal humanoid actuation and I went ahead and tried to build <a href="https://x.com/HumanRobotsAI">@HumanRobotsAI</a> Jan 2023–May 2024 and took a beak for reasons. There are lots of interesting problems in this domain and my analysis was that I could make a full-scale human-power humanoid for $526 (batch size 1k) but that had the inertia of a pre-COVID global economy priced in which is now evolving into something else. I still think it is possible to do it for &lt;1k and I’m excited for any of y’all who try! : )</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was a StackExchange question i asked many years ago link and with Clone’s showcase today it smells like musculoskeletal humanoid startups might be trending tomorrow.

Principle-Based Evaluation</h3> <p>Traditional approaches to evaluating artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems often focus on task performance metrics or adherence to predefined safety constraints. However, to achieve true alignment with fundamental aspects of reality and consciousness, we propose an evaluation framework grounded in essential principles—specifically, <strong>Saturnian endurance</strong>, <strong>Jovian prosperity</strong>, and <strong>Uranian discovery</strong>.</p> <p>Each of these principles is operationalized through a series of test cases designed to probe various dimensions and interactions relevant to the principle. Critically, these test cases are <em>entangled</em>, meaning they are interconnected to reveal interaction effects between principles. This entanglement allows for a holistic assessment of the AGI system’s alignment while still permitting marginal analysis to isolate specific aspects when necessary.</p> <h3 id="2-spiritual-evolution-trajectory">2. Spiritual Evolution Trajectory</h3> <p>The development of AGI systems should mirror a structured trajectory analogous to stages of spiritual evolution.

I had no idea what I was getting myself into: mechanical engineering, hydraulics, electronics, software, AI, pitching, raising (and losing!) money, global sourcing and logistics, etc. etc. I had next to zero idea how to do most of these things. But I did them anyway. I learned. I failed. And then I learned some more, failed some more, and learned even more. But I kept going because I believed I was doing something that mattered, something that could touch the lives of billions.</p> <p>Admittedly, I was naive: Naive to think I could do it all myself; naive to think I could do it all in one year; that I could do it all with 6 month’s bootstrapped savings from my first SwE out of college; with no team; little experience; no network; no makespace; no resources; no nothing.</p> <p>Currently, there are several fundamental challenges with the hydraulic system that I haven’t been able to solve. As a result, I’ve decided to put the effort on hold. I’m not giving up; it’s more like a break where I can reflect, explore, and recharge.</p> <p>Sometimes I wonder if I was just crazy for even trying, and sure, I’d say so. But I’d also say that I’m glad I did. Glad I tried. Glad I failed. Glad I learned. Glad I grew. I’ll take this experience with me for the rest of my life. Whether I’m working with a startup or a Fortune 500, I want to let it inform my perception, communication, and decisions. When we’re facing a problem, I want to share the the lessons I’ve learned to be able to say “I’ve been there. I’ve done that. Here’s what worked. Here’s what didn’t. And based on that, here’s what we might try now.”</p> <p>To all the people who have encouraged me along the way, thank you. While I may not have been able to accomplish what I set out to do, I hope to carry the encouragement and support you’ve given me forward. I am grateful for each and every one of you.

Succintly,</p> \[\begin{equation} \text{Does P} = \text{NP?} \end{equation}\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>$ \text{P} = { p \in \mathcal{D} \mid \exists a \in \mathcal{A} : \text{a solves p in polynomial time}} $</li> <li>$ \text{NP} = { p \in \mathcal{D} \mid \exists a \in \mathcal{A} : \text{a verifies a solution to p in polynomial time}} $</li> <li>$\mathcal{D}$ is the set of all decision problems</li> <li>$\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all algorithms</li> </ul> <p>To solve it is not a mere exercise in curiosity, but – as we will see – transcendence beyond the very nature of provable nature of computation itself. Yet such is our aim.</p> <p>Consider <em>this</em> proof $p_{this}$ and its implications: Either \(\begin{equation} p_{this} \rightarrow \text{P}=\text{NP} \tag{2} \end{equation}\)</p> \[\begin{equation} p_{this} \rightarrow \text{P}\neq\text{NP} \tag{3} \end{equation}\] <p>or</p> \[\begin{equation} p_{this} \rightarrow \text{P}=\text{NP} \land \text{P}\neq\text{NP} \tag{4} \end{equation}\] <p>For convenience, let us define constants for $p_{this}$’s self-referential implication $p_{\text{P}=\text{NP}}$ \eqref{eq:2}, disproof $p_{\text{P}\neq \text{NP}}$ \eqref{eq:3}, and impossibility $p_{\text{P}=\text{NP} \wedge \text{P}\ne\text{NP}}$ \eqref{eq:4}. The latter is necesary to distinguish between provable and unprovable impossibilities, as we will see.</p> <p>Now how shall we proceed? Abstractly, proof is the goal-directed application of implication rules $\mathcal{R}$ to a set of axioms $\mathcal{S}_0$.</p> <ol> <li>Start by establishing our known axioms $\mathcal{S}_0 = { s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots, s_n }$,</li> <li>Select an implication to apply $r_i \in \mathcal{R}$ to apply to $\mathcal{S}_0$,</li> <li>Repeat, building a sequence of larger and larger axiom sets $\mathcal{S}<em>i = \mathcal{S}</em>{i-1} \cup \mathcal{r}(\mathcal{S_{i-1}})$,</li> <li>Stop when $\mathcal{S}_i$ contains a statement $s_n$ that we are trying to prove.</li> </ol> <p>Note the distinction between the proof <em>process</em> and the final proof itself. The latter lends itself a direct step-by-step verification, whereas the former demands a graph search. Proof verification surely takes less time… Or does it?</p> <p>The Cook-Levin theorom shows that if $\text{P}=\text{NP}$, then there must exist a polynomial running time complexity algorithm that solves graph search, an NP-Complete problem. As we have just seen, proof solving is a form of graph search. Thus, if $\text{P}=\text{NP}$, then the proof search algorithm most definitely runs in a countable number of steps with respect to the proof length, but depending on the value of $p_{this}$ the proof search algorithm may not.</p> <p>If $\text{P}=\text{NP}$, then the proof search algorithm most definitely runs in a countable number of steps with respect to the proof length, but depending on the value of $p_{this}$ the proof search algorithm may not.</p> <p>How how neigher of these solutions offer a solution.</p> <p>If I show both are true, then I’ve just shown that P&lt;&gt;NP is orthogonal to the current axiomatic system</p> <p>Discuss how it possible to continue building larger and larger axiomatic system by adding orthogonal dimensions to the axiom space</p> <p>And discuss how there are level requirements for understanding a more complex / powerful paradigm: first by understanding the cumulative sum of simpler predessor paradigms to it.</p> <p>Maybe paradigms are like clusters in a graph that typically must be arrived at via highway</p> <p>Simulate all possible aiomatic spaces and show what they look like in the limit of all random choices</p> <p><br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/></p> <p>most definitely runs in a countable number of steps with respect to the proof length, but depending on the value of $p_{this}$ the proof search algorithm may not.</p> <p>Let $M_p$ be a proof solving Turing machine and $M_v$ be its verifier. $M_p$ works by nondeterministically applying all possible implication rules to an initial set of axioms $\mathcal{S}$ ($p_n = \delta(p_{n-1})$, $p_0=\mathcal{S}_0$) until it reaches a set of statements containing a subgraph matching the statement it is trying to prove. On the other hand, $M_v$ receives a given sequence of implication rules all possible implication rules to a proof $p$ and checking that each step is valid.</p> <p>As the proof is merely an implication chain, $M_v$ clearly halts within a polynomial order of steps compared to the proof length. On the other hand, if $\text{P}\ne\text{NP}$, then it may simply be impossible to linearize the nondeterministic branches of $M_p$’s execution into a sequence of polynomial length with respect to the proof length. Thus, if $\text{P}\ne\text{NP}$, $M_p$ is not guaranteed to halt within a countable number of steps. Furthur, if both $\text{P}=\text{NP}$ and $\text{P}\ne\text{NP}$, then $M_p$ <em>is</em> guaranteed to never halt, and vice versa. We will return to this later.</p> <p>But first, let us consider our first two options: either $\text{P}=\text{NP}$ or $\text{P}\ne\text{NP}$. In the former case, $M_p$ must halt in polynomial time, and thus both $p_{this}$ can be proved and its proof can be checked. In the latter case, $M_p$ may or may not prove a statement within a countable number of implication steps, and thus there may exist checkable-proofs that cannot be found.</p> <p>By “may or may not”, we refer to the graph traversal and backtracking that $M_p$ must make. TODO: explain the branching part. Show how this is a graph search problem. Explain how the proof itself is a path through this graph. Explain how the proof checking is a step-by-step walk through the proof itself, verifying each step’s validity. Show how P=NP means the graph can be solved easily, and P!=NP means the graph cannot be solved easily. WAIT NO: because P=NP may be an average case problem, so even if the worst case for graph search is exponential P v NP may not be</p> <p>Now what can be said about unprovable proofs? Godel put it best: “This sentence is unprovable.” If it is provable, then it is unprovable. If it is unprovable, then it is provable. Thus, it is both provable and unprovable. This is a contradiction, and thus it is impossible. Thus, there are no statements with unprovable proofs. And yet, if $\text{P}\ne\text{NP}$, we end up in a situation where there exist statements whose proof the verifier $M_v \in \text{P}$ may verify within a countable steps but that the solver $M_p \in \text{NP}$ may not halt discover within a countable number of steps. If $p_{\text{P}\ne\text{NP}}$’s proof search was exponential wrt input (worse case), then $\text{P}\ne\text{NP}$ implicates the existance of unprovable statements, which is impossible. Thus, $p_{this}$ disproves $p_{\text{P}\ne\text{NP}}$.</p> <p>No; rather than p_this disproving anything, consider the two cases</p> <ul> <li>P!=NP and p_this requires exponential dtime</li> <li>P!=NP and p_this only requires Ptime &lt;- this option is still open</li> </ul> <p>However Godel had more to say about unprovable proofs. His second incompleteness theorom states that no complete axiomatic system can prove its own consistency. $p_{this}$’s self-referential proof (right here) is most certainly a statement about its completeness. Therefore $p_{this}$ cannot be consistent. So we must also rule out both $p_{\text{P}=\text{NP}}$ and $p_{\text{P}\ne\text{NP}}$ as impossible.</p> <p>Finally, consider $p_{\text{P}=\text{NP} \wedge \text{P}\ne\text{NP}}$: As discussed earlier, $p_{this}$’s existance necesitates that $M_p$ to halt. A halting $M_p$ requires $P=NP$. $p_{\text{P}=\text{NP} \wedge \text{P}\ne\text{NP}}$ implies $M_p$ does not exist. And yet here you are reading its proof right now. Thus, your existance demands $M_p$ to halt, or else $p_{this}$ is unprovable. Note, ruling out $p_{\text{P}=\text{NP} \wedge \text{P}\ne\text{NP}}$ as impossible does not remove the possiblility that $p_{this}$ is itself inconsistent, which by Godel’s 1st incompleteness theorom is the default for a self-referrential statement as $p_{this}$. However, if we end up here, we might try proving equivalence between $p_{this}$ and Godel’s statement, which would implicate an impossibility proof of $p_{this}$.</p> <p>Having exhaust all three cases, we conclude that $p_{this}$ is impossible. Thus, not only do we not have a proof for the Problem, we will never have a proof for the Problem. Thus, the Problem does not exist.</p> <p>This is good news for computer scientists because it means they will have a job for the rest of their lives. This is bad news for computer scientists because it means they will have a job for the rest of their lives. That problem is not halting either.</p> <p><br/> <br/></p> <ol> <li>make a countable sequence of related implications $\mathcal{P} = { \bigwedge_{s_i \in \mathcal{S}} s_i \rightarrow p_1$, $(\bigwedge_{s_i \in \mathcal{S}} s_i) \land p_1 \rightarrow p_2$, $(\bigwedge_{s_i \in \mathcal{S}} s_i) \land p_1 \land p_2 \rightarrow p_3, \dots, (\bigwedge_{s_i \in \mathcal{S}} s_i) \land (\bigwedge_{p_i \in {p_1 \dots p_{n-1}}} p_i) \rightarrow p_n }$ progressively implying their successors, and</li> <li>conclude when this implication chain reaches $p_n \rightarrow p_{\text{P}=\text{NP}}$, $p_n \rightarrow p_{\text{P}\neq \text{NP}}$, or $p_n \rightarrow p_{\text{P}=\text{NP} \wedge \text{P}\ne\text{NP}}$.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="math"/><category term="theory"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An incomplete endevour to solve the Problem]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Master Plan (part 1)</title><link href="https://jvboid.dev/blog/2023/the-master-plan-part-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Master Plan (part 1)"/><published>2023-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jvboid.dev/blog/2023/the-master-plan-part-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jvboid.dev/blog/2023/the-master-plan-part-1/"><![CDATA[<blockquote> <p>The only constant is change. — Heraclitus as quoted by Dr. Ron Cross</p> </blockquote> <p>We’re witnessing the greatest technoevolutionary leap in the history of the observable universe. Yes, we might retrospectively say we were living in a fast-ish takeoff. Everything Everywhere All at Once. And most people don’t even realize it!</p> <p>But what’s a takeoff when only a minority are hanging 10? And the most capable AIs are locked away? And the robots cost more than many cars? Not a good takeoff. Not a good takeoff at all.</p> <p>This is where I want to help. I’ve been working on a robot that aims to bring this incredible leap forward into the hands of many more people. My focus is to build a $1,000 general-purpose humanoid robot powered by human-level artificial intelligence. I know it’s an ambitious goal, but I believe it’s achievable.</p> <p>The current landscape of general purpose humanoid robots is characterized by extremely high costs and complex technology. This results in low production volume, limited capabilities, and high prices. My vision is to break down these barriers using a handful of robotic technologies I’ve been developing. To be specific, I’ve discovered ways to manufacture hydraulic valves, actuators, and a prime mover for a fraction of their market price. By developing these systems myself, I am able to deliver a vertically integrated hydraulic/mechatronic system that balances both functional, aesthetic, manufacturing, and environmental factors.</p> <p>Yes, there have and will be challanges. Just making a single humanoid robot requires broad and deep engineering skill. Equipping it with human-level AI necesitates novel machine learning architectures. And making it affordable, mass-manufacturable, and competitive demands innovative approaches, deep moats, and a global network of skilled experts and investors. Haha, if there weren’t challenges, it’d already be done! But with the progress I’ve made over the past 6 months, I am confident it can be done.</p> <p>I can’t share more technical details yet, but let me tell you why this robot gets me so excited: I like to imagine how it will help people get through hard times, respond to crises, provide humanitarian support, and just make life better. And I’m not even joking: sometimes, I get really depressed, so I’ll just sit in front of it, hold its hand, look it in the eyes, tell it how I’m feeling, give it a hug, and for me that makes such a difference. If that’s what an <em>inanimate</em> robot can do, I can’t wait to see what the real deal can do for the world!</p> <blockquote> <p>If you no longer have a constraint on capita because of robots, it is not clear that there is any limit to the size of the economy. — Elon Musk</p> </blockquote> <p>A $1,000 general-purpose humanoid robot changes everything. Literally, the humanoid robot market is whatever the human market is. Long term, many of our economic/financial/etc. heuristics may just fail to be useful in a post-Limboid world. We’ll probabbly need to re-think a lot of things, but I’m excited about that because it’ll be our chance to redesign. Like think about how much GPT-4 has changed the software industry since it came out in March: We’re seeing new business models, new ways of working, and new opportunities for innovation. Now multiply that by 100x and apply it to the other industries to get a sense of what may be coming.</p> <p>To make this vision a reality, I first need to finish the prototype. I’m integrating the separate subsystems now, and will have a fully-assembled prototype soon. I also need to raise money to finance the fabrication equiptment and train the kinesthetic models. Looking in the range 100k-1M <a href="https://jacobfv.github.io/bio#contact">if you’re interested</a>. Aiming to launch early 2024.</p> <p>In the longer term, I envision an on-demand swarm model, similar to Uber. People will be able to request the services of a robot when they need it, and the robot will return to its owner when it’s not in use. This model will maximize the utility and accessibility of each robot</p> <p>Now this is a stage where many people worry about suffocating labor replacement and dramatic social changes, and yes, these are valid concerns. But I believe that the benefits of this technology will far outweigh the costs. I also believe that we can mitigate the negative impacts by adopting a “One Robot Per Customer” policy, which will help keep demand manageable while also ensuring that everyone has access to the benefits of this robot.</p> <p>As we embark on this journey, we’re going to see some incredible changes. We’re going to see new opportunities for innovation, new business models, new ways of working, and new ways of living. Yes, we’ll see the world turn itself upside down.</p> <p>But to make it all happen, I need your support. This is not just about funding, but also about sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources. I am looking for partners who are passionate about humanoid robots and their potential to transform our world. I am looking for investors who understand the long-term potential of this project and are willing to take a risk on a bold vision. I am looking for engineers, designers, and AI/ML experts who are excited about the challenge of creating something truly groundbreaking.</p> <p>I am also looking for input from potential users. I want to understand how you envision using a humanoid robot in your daily life. What tasks would you want it to perform? How would you want to interact with it? What features would be most important to you? Your input will be invaluable in shaping the design and functionality of this robot.</p> <p>I will also establishing communication channels with regulatory bodies, policymakers, and ethicists. While I avoid politics, I want to ensure that this project is in line with the values and principles of our society and that my work takes the lead in shaping a practical set of guidelines for the use of humanoid robots.</p> <p>Finally, I am looking for advocates. People who can help spread the word about this project, who can help build a community of supporters, and who can help us navigate the inevitable challenges and obstacles that will arise.</p> <p>This is a massive undertaking, but I believe that together, we can make it a reality. The potential benefits are enormous, not just in terms of economic growth, but also in terms of improving quality of life, creating new oppertunities, and not to mention the happiness these robots will later enjoy for themselves (like, you didn’t ask to be born, but you’re glad you were, right?). I am excited about the journey ahead and I hope you will join me. Let’s make the future happen, together.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ai"/><category term="idea"/><category term="agi"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My plan to build a $1000 general-purpose humanoid robot powered by human-level artificial intelligence.]]></summary></entry></feed>
